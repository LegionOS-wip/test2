<!-- > ”America is somewhere between dire straights and dead.”
> 
> — Peter Thiel

Innovation across almost every American industry, which had seen steady upwards progress in the late 20th century, had reached a plateau at the turn of the millennium. As the dual dogmas of globalization and financialization took root, the American economy shifted its focus away from innovating and towards rent-seeking activities in order to generate profits. This paper will attempt to argue that the period of tremendous strides in American innovation from the 1940s to the 1990s was possible in part due to the continuous state of war, starting with World War II and through the Cold War. The impending existential conflict pushed the American people, government, and society to enter, out of desperation, an “economic state of exception”, in which they were able to ignore economic rationality in order to invest their time, money, and effort toward radical causes―many of which lead to technological innovation―that would be infeasible or too risky for profit-seeking entities. The end of the Cold War freed America from the existential threats of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, forcing it to shift back into normal capitalistic tendencies, which promotes rent-seeking behavior over investment into technological innovation.

The half-century from 1940 to 1990 saw unprecedented technological innovation that pushed humanity forward through a multitude of new inventions, from nuclear power to the Green Revolution, from the television to the computer, from the Internet to the cell phone. This generation saw a man on the moon, smallpox eradicated, and air travel brought to the masses. Anthropologist David Graeber notes that for many who grew up in the fast-changing world of the second half of the 20th century, such rapid innovation had come to be seen as expected and led to grand visions of the future of technology.

The preceding generation, who grew up reading Jules Verne or H.G. Wells around the turn of the 20th century were told that by mid-century they would have things as far-fetched as flying machines, submarines, rockets, and televisions―and the second half of the 20th century, indeed, delivered. In contrast, the modern world did not deliver the technological progress that Cold War era science fiction predicted. Back to the Future II told us we would have flying cars and hoverboards by 2015. Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey thought that by the turn of the millennium we’d be flying on commercial flights to the moon, developing strong AI computer personalities, and building city space stations. The original Star Trek thought that by the nineties we’d already have had our first war against genetically engineered superhumans. So, why didn’t progress deliver the world it was expected to? It is necessary, perhaps, to first uncover where progress originates from.

Graeber, despite being a prolific anarchist, admits that much of the innovation that happened in the era was due to government action. He explains that “the Apollo program was a Big Government project, Soviet-inspired in the sense that it required a national effort coordinated by government bureaucracies.” Indeed, many of the innovations mentioned so far have roots in government projects or public-private collaborations. This pro-state narrative is upheld by Italian-American economist Mariana Mazzucato, who claims that even innovations typically thought of as feats of private industry tend to have roots in state investment. For example, the personal computer is often considered the creation of Silicon Valley, its invention credited to the efforts of companies like Apple, HP, and IBM. However, this ignores the massive influence that government played through its role in establishing “new computer science departments at various universities in the USA” and funding the research that led to the creation and growth of Silicon Valley. According to John Aubrey Douglass’s paper The Cold War, Technology, and the American University, “The federal government was limping toward a sort of industrial policy…Since American industry was failing to invest in sufficient research and development to bring new products to market that could compete internationally…the government provided public funds to universities to help move the fruits of basic research into the marketplace.”

Government funding is not only the bedrock of computer technology, but also of numerous other fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. This same pattern of private industry building off the work of government continues even today. The self-driving car industry is built upon decades of research done by DARPA. Many of the companies created by “future visionary” Elon Musk like Tesla and SpaceX only exist because of funding and investment from the government. The iPhone, while a brilliant product by Apple, was built by amalgamating a number of government-created technologies such as cellular technology, GPS, the Internet, and Siri.

What is especially interesting to note, however, is that not only are these component technologies created by the state, most of them were created by a specific sector of the government―the military. Cellular technology was developed by the military to communicate during Operation Desert Storm. The Global Positioning System was created for military and intelligence applications. The precursor to the Internet, ARPANET, was created by the Department of Defense to allow for the sharing of intelligence across military networks. Looking even slightly further back in history, the first general-purpose computer was designed by Alan Turing as a way to break Nazi Enigma code. Nuclear energy came from the weaponry designed to end World War II. The rocketry built for space exploration started as rocketry built for missiles. Even the airplane, while invented by the Wright brothers, private individuals, truly only reached its potential when its use as a weapon was discovered during World War I and was improved when the German military invented the jet engine during World War II.

It is no coincidence that the military is responsible for so much innovation; the investment required to innovate to such an extent is often too risky or even irrational for private enterprise to pursue. Non-monopolistic, profit-seeking firms in a capitalist system have little ability to take risks and pursue innovation. Peter Thiel, in his book Zero to One notes the economic principle that “under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.” Without long-term profit, most companies are unable to accumulate enough capital to invest in high risk innovation. Thiel continues, “In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long-term future.” Essentially, for a profit-seeking company, it doesn’t make sense for them to invest in innovation, but rather focus on either building a monopoly to escape competition (extremely difficult for most firms) or on gaining short term profits. Historical sociologist Greta Krippner notes that the pattern of accumulation for short term profits leans towards rent-seeking methods rather than production and innovation. In Capitalizing on Crisis: The Political Origins of the Rise of Finance, she writes that if given the opportunity, the “profit making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production.” So, if private capitalistic firms are unable to pursue innovation, why are the government and military able to do so?

Simply, they had the ability to operate outside the sphere of traditional economics. The fact that the nation was in the state of war gave the military the capacity to spend money on things it wouldn’t have been able to in a time of peace. For example, the Manhattan Project costed $23 billion dollars and was, to an extent, a gamble as to whether it would actually work. Such a risky investment would likely not normally have been made; however, given the circumstances, it was necessary because of the dangerous potential that Nazi Germany might build an atomic weapon first. In order to overcome economics, the war need not even be physical; it can be an ideological conflict as well. Going to the moon, arguably one of the greatest feats of mankind, is ultimately an extremely economically irrational thing to do. Manned space travel is not even an efficient way to engage in scientific research. However, our ideological battle for “global supremacy” with the Soviet Union made the space race a political imperative, no matter the economic cost. It also affected investment into consumer technology in order to “prove that our society was better”. Graeber writes that “America’s rivalry with the Soviet Union made innovation appear to accelerate. There [were]…frenetic efforts by U.S. industrial planners to apply existing technologies to consumer purposes, to create an optimistic sense of burgeoning prosperity…”. This sense of fundamental rivalry pushed both sides to invest into highly optimistic (but ultimately unsuccessful) grand projects. The United States attempted to build its global “Star Wars system” while the Soviet Union tried to solve its energy problems “by launching hundreds of gigantic solar-power platforms into orbit and beaming the electricity back to earth.” These projects may seem insane, but it was exactly this kind of moonshot thinking that was enabled through the state of conflict, and perhaps if the Cold War had lasted longer may have even one day seen completion. It is important to remember that the state is still subservient to society and its actions react to the sentiment of society. So what convinced the capitalistic-minded American society to agree to high taxes in order to fund extravagant government spending? Throughout history, powerful forces and ideologies have pushed people to overcome economic rationality such as religion or Manifest Destiny, which helped propel American expansionism through much of the 19th century. During the 20th century, however, it was the state of war that was the political force that superseded society’s economic rationality.

To understand how this works, we can turn to Carl Schmitt’s Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty. In this work, Schmitt introduces the concept of the “state of exception” in which the “sovereign” is able to execute complete control over the state suspending its political systems, the constitution, and individual liberties for the purpose of serving the common good. We can narrow Schmitt’s idea by specifying it as a “political state of exception”, in which a crisis allows for subversion of the political norm. From this, we can then theorize the economic parallel to this, which we will aptly call an “economic state of exception”. We will define this as a situation in which a crisis allows for the subversion of the economic norm. Schmitt defines a crisis or exception as “a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state, or the like.” From this it’s very easy to make the claim that the Cold War, which provided people with the constant peril of the worry of nuclear attack at any minute, created an economic state of exception that temporarily suspended the capitalistic economic norm. Both kinds of states of exceptions are very dangerous tools. Political states of exceptions can lead to “good sovereigns” such as Julius Caesar or “bad sovereigns” such as Adolf Hitler. In the same vein, economic states of exception can also result in positive or negative outcomes. Both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in high levels of investment spending in order to win the Cold War, but in the end, the United States ended up making massive technological advancements while the Soviet Union ended up overspending itself to its ultimate destruction. Regardless, it was this economics state of exception which enabled American society and thus the American government to pursue its innovative moonshots projects.

Once the peril associated with the Cold War ended, the state of exception also came to an end. Once society decided that unrestrained investment was no longer necessary or in the national interest, the state had lost its mandate to operate in the exception and had to accommodate to society’s sentiment. One of Newt Gingrich’s first acts upon winning the House of Representatives in 1995 was to defund the Office of Technological Assessment (OTA) citing it as an example of useless government extravagance. Since the end of the 1990s government has become increasingly less innovative, having turned its focus away from innovating and towards things like redistributing money. In every year since the end of the Cold War, government entitlement spending has eclipsed discretionary spending. After the Cold War, the government even began to mimic some of neoliberal values espoused by industry and society, which cause it to further falter in the realm of innovation. Graeber writes that “The increasing interpenetration of government, university, and private firms has led everyone to adopt the language, sensibilities, and organizational forms that originated in the corporate world. Although this might have helped in creating marketable products, since that is what corporate bureaucracies are designed to do, in terms of fostering original research, the results have been catastrophic.” A similar period of stagnation occurred during the interwar period of the 1920s in which innovation halted and America regressed to isolationism and financialization, which led in part to the depression of the 1930s which lasted until a new state of exception was triggered in America with the attack on Pearl Harbor.

However, to say that innovation has completely come to a halt since the end of Cold War would be ingenuous. There is one industry that has accelerated in its rate of innovation — information technology. To explain this, we have to remember that once the Cold War ended, it did not mean the end of ideological conflict and war forever. Schmitt argued that fundamental conflict will always exist between philosophically opposed entities. The opportunity for a new state of exception came on September 11, 2001 when America was attacked by a type of enemy it had never faced before. Unlike previous conventional wars or even the Cold War, in which we were fighting a known enemy, America was now at war with an enemy that it could not easily trace or find and used the new digital realm to its advantage. Thus, to eliminate the new peril, innovation wasn’t required in new rocketry, nuclear weaponry, or transportation systems. Instead, this modern warfare required mastery over information and the digital realm — exactly where governmental innovation is focused in the 21st century, in communications and surveillance technologies.

What can we learn from this narrative that claims to link the rapid governmental innovation of the latter half of the 20th century to the state of war due to the theory of economic states of exception? Does this mean that the only solution to technological stagnation is to start a new global war and put ourselves in a state of peril like the Cold War once again? Not quite. Economic states of exceptions are simply one way to overcome societal economic norms. Any sort of ideology that can convince society to value something beyond short term economic profits can achieve similar results. As discussed earlier, much of the rapid American innovation in the 19th century in industries such as railroads was propelled not by fear of an existential threat but by the more positive belief in ideals such as Manifest Destiny. It may be possible to reorient societal values towards something that for example values scientific curiosity over economic concerns. Even if we adopt the pessimistic view that only states of exception can motivate our society, there is still the possibility that the “crisis” we face does not have to be another nation or group; it just has to be an existential threat to society. If we could get society to rally around something like fighting the existential threat of climate change, we can overcome our natural capitalistic tendencies and use the economic state of exception to both advance technology and save the planet.

This past week, I attended the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) Winter Conference, hosted at Chain in San Francisco. There, Chain provided everyone with a notepad, and I noticed this quote from the musical Hamilton at the bottom of the pamphlet.


> “In the face of ignorance and resistance, I wrote financial systems into existence.”
> 
> — Alexander Hamilton (But actually Lin Manuel Miranda)

For those who don’t know, I’ve always been quite interested in Alexander Hamilton (even before the musical!), and so when the musical came out, as you can imagine, I was obsessed.

I couldn’t help but find that quote so beautiful and fitting for all the work I do with cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. Often, I wonder if dedicating this much time to Blockchain is worth it; after all I could be spending my efforts in fields with far more promising prospects such as AI, Virtual Reality, etc. However, this quote gave me renowned vigor and passion to continue despite the “ignorance and resistance” to this new financial system.
  I spend **a lot** of time on YouTube watching what I call “educational channels” on topics ranging from science to geopolitics to philosophy. I started off with most of the “big names” like VSauce, CGPGrey, and CrashCourse, but over the years I’ve amassed quite a collection of channels including a lot of smaller, but equally awesome content producers. I often have friends ask me to recommend them some channels, so I’ve went ahead and created this page to organize my educational subscriptions by topic.

  People often ask me why I decided to come all the way across the country to California for college. Of course there’s the obvious answers of being close to Silicon Valley and that UC Berkeley is one of the top schools in the nations. However, for me, there was something else, a sort of romanticization of moving west to California.

![](/images/medium/0_L8z5wloEnyJj7hYs.png)

Even in my obligatory college acceptance Facebook post, I used the famous (misattributed to) Horace Greeley quote.While for many people, “California” evokes images of surfing, palm trees, and Hollywood. However, for me, as cheesy as it sounds, “California” has always been the manifestation of “the American Dream”. Of course, my passion for history definitely plays a role in this romanticization. The idea of Manifest Destiny compelled generation upon generation to push west onto the American frontier, where enterprising men (and women) could make a new life for themselves. And the final destination of this westward push is none other than “the Golden Coast”. Whether it’s the 49er Gold Miner, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur, or the aspiring Hollywood actor, California has always been the place for people to go in order to “take a shot” and try to “make it big”.

The reason I decided to write this now, is I recently happened upon this song, “Go West” by Anti-Flag and couldn’t help but share. I have an entire playlist in my music collection called “California” but I think this song, especially the chorus, is the first I’ve come across that’s truly encapsulated the emotion and meaning that California and the American West has always had for me. Take a listen.

In his work *The Great Transformation*, Polanyi writes that the Gold Standard was the single “common tenet to men of all nations and all classes, religious denominations, and social philosophy.” He notes that previous economists saw the Gold Standard as just an economic institution and chides them for not recognizing its political and social implications. Polanyi goes on to claim that the abandonment of the Gold Standard represents one of the main signals of the turning point away from the liberal “19th Century Civilization” to the fragmented 20th century (he was writing as World War 2 raged in the world around him).

Polanyi’s claim is that the search for a stable, non-gold currency led a turn to autarchized national governments as a source of stability. Without the a single standard tying economies together, each nation now had more total control over its own economy. This level of increase in localized, concentrated power caused the rise of dictatorships and fascist regimes across Europe. The liberal state based around belief in free markets gave yield to “new forms of economy” often based around central planning as seen in the Soviet Five-Year Plans, the American New Deal, and Nazism in Germany. Most notably, Polanyi claimed that the balance of power system created after World War 1 by the league of nations could not work for peace because the international monetary system was not restored.

  In the remotes for a number of the major popular tv streaming boxes, the remote designs are extremely similar.

![](/images/medium/1*1URBNLhZKfm0mH1jGAJalw.png){: .center-image .hero }

They all feature a similar design of a 4-directional pad with a select button in the center (and the pad is often shaped as a circle except with the Roku TV) and a few more buttons below for function such as “Back”, “Home”, and “Pause/Play”. The Nvidia Shield TV that comes with a full game controller still includes a traditional “streaming box remote” because the design has become the “known convention”. But what happens when someone tries to be “innovative” and break the accepted convention? The Apple TV’s new “Siri remote decided to forgo the traditional 4-directional pad and replaced it with a touch screen.

  Today, Switzerland is one of the most successful countries in the world, boasting one of the highest GDPs per capita, standard of living, and economic freedom indices. Beyond its reluctance to engage in conflict, desire to stay out of supranational unions, and high degree of libertarianism, Switzerland remains unique relative to its European neighbors in another astounding way: it has four national languages. The Swiss population is split amongst two major language groups, German in the East and French in the West, with a third minor linguistic group, Italian, concentrated in the South. Its fourth national language, Romansch, is known by less than 0.5% of the population. Despite this lack of linguistic unity, the Swiss people manage to maintain a cohesive identity. Meanwhile, the close-by and similarly-sized European country of Belgium has extremely similar linguistically diverse demographics; the population is roughly half split amongst two major language groups, French and Flemish (a dialect of Dutch), with a concentrated third minor linguistic group, German. However, unlike Switzerland, Belgium lacks strong national unity and suffers from frequent secessionary movements. In this paper, I will explore how Switzerland managed to forge a single national identity despite its multiple language groups, and compare this to Belgium’s failure to do so, specifically focusing on the effects of ethno-symbolic nation-building, linguistic inclusiveness, and decentralized federalism.

Before we can begin to examine the causes of Switzerland’s unique nationalism, we must examine the nature of nationality itself within Switzerland. Unlike its neighbors such as Germany, there is no evidence to indicate that the Swiss ever had the desire to create a monoethnic state. There was no form of ethnic cleansing, suppression of minorities, or any other form of “Swissification”. In fact, Switzerland’s ethnic and linguistic diversity has often been seen as a point of pride to many Swiss citizens. We commonly refer to countries with such varied ethnicities as multinational states. However, calling Switzerland a multinational state would be disingenuous. A multinational state is one in which the members of multiple nations occupy one political state. However, in the minds of most Swiss citizens, Switzerland has only one nationality: the Swiss. No linguistic group in Switzerland has ever fought for secession, sought unification with linguistically similar neighbors, or formed an ethnicity-based national party. Switzerland is not a multinational state, but rather a multi-linguistic state, one where diversity of languages forms a core component of its national identity.

This stands in stark contrast to Belgium. Unlike Switzerland, Belgium is fraught with growing discord. Emblematic of this divide is the linguistic indicator that the French and Flemish speaking sides of Belgium have unique and distinct identities called Wallonia and Flanders, respectively. Despite similar linguistic divide in Switzerland, there is no term for the French-speaking or German-speaking sides of Switzerland. Since the country’s founding in 1830, French-speaking Wallonia and German-speaking Flanders have had major problems in working together. Historically, the Flemish have felt persecuted and would fight for equality with the Walloons. In recent years, the divide has become stronger than ever. In 2010–2011, due to a stalemate caused by opposing Flemish and Walloon parties, there were 541 days without an active government. Furthermore, many Flemish citizens support secession or greater Flemish autonomy, and there are even major political parties such as the New Flemish Alliance built on a secessionary platform.

To understand the causes of the difference in national mindset between Switzerland and Belgium, we must trace back the history of these countries to their founding. The Old Swiss Confederacy began in 1301 as an alliance between three cantons, purely for economic and defensive purposes in defending the sparse trade routes in the mountainous region and protecting against the tyranny of the Holy Roman Empire and Habsburg dukes. As the centuries went on, more cantons joined the alliance, but it remained just that, an alliance with no semblance of a central state. Furthermore, the people saw themselves as solely members of their own canton, with little in common with the people of other cantons. In his paper “A Swiss anomaly? A relational account of national boundary-making,” Andreas Wimmer argues that multi-cantonal organizations such as reading groups, hiking clubs, and research teams, set the seeds for future inter-cantonal relationships. While a sense of community was growing, the people’s’ sense of identity still remained with their cantons. The story of how this loose alliance of cantons became a singular nation is the crown jewel of the ethno-symbolism school of nationalism.

During the French invasion of Switzerland during the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, the French set up a Republican government to govern the Swiss region. While the Republican government was very short-lived, during its time, it promoted an idea of “Swiss-nationness” that pervaded the mindsets of many of the elites, even after independence from France and the falling back into a confederation. While Zimmer focuses on the actions of the elites, he does note that the movement had support across social classes. He explains that the group of elites, now wanting the create a national Swiss mindset needed to turn the alliance of numerous nationalistic cantons into a single national identity. However, not only did the Swiss nation-builders integrate the confederation of cantons, it did so in a way that was acceptable to and agreed upon by all of the language communities. However, this was not universally accepted at first, as resistance to centralization led to the Sonderbund (separate alliance), a coalition of largely Catholic (although there were Catholic cantons that did not join the Sonderbund) that favored localization over centralization. After a very short civil war in 1847 which lasted only a few weeks and claimed the lives of less than 100 people, the Sonderbund was defeated, and a new federalist constitution was created in which the political federal elite would not intervene in the cultural, linguistic, or educational traditions of individual cantons. These terms were suitable, and even the Sonderbund cantons got on board. In these realms, the cantons had essentially the same levels of autonomy both before and after 1847.

While this created a common political identity, bound by respect for direct democracy, federalism, and political rights, this does not explain the common national identity. Unlike their peers in neighboring countries like France, Germany, and Italy that could use common culture, ethnicity, and language, the Swiss elites turned nation-builders instead had to turn to adopting rhetoric and evoking symbols in order to stir nationalist “memory”. Out of these symbols including a flag, hymns, and national days, two of the most powerful were the geographic pride as the “Land of the Alps” and great national stories about lore such as the founding of the Old Confederacy, its valiant defense against foreign invaders, and national folk heroes like William Tell. However, the vital observation in this analysis is that most of these symbols were not created in 1848. The people were not somehow brainwashed into thinking that they grew up listening to the folktales as children. The Alps were not magically sprung from the Earth for the purpose of nation building. Rather, existing ideas and symbols that were already in the minds of the people were revitalized and repurposed for community-building goals. Even the Swiss flag was a revival of a 14th century military insignia worn by the Old Swiss Confederation and the National Day is based on the supposed date of the creation of the Old Confederacy in the 13th century.

Compared to Switzerland’s extensive nation-building process, Belgium’s is extremely lacking, contributing to the lack of national unity from the onset of the country. The Belgian state began in 1830 as a series of riots that grew into a southern independence movement from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands fueled by Catholicism, anti-central authority sentiment, and resentment towards the more industrious North. Interestingly, this has quite a few parallels to the Sonderbund separation attempt in Switzerland, with the exception that this secession succeeded; however, this is a topic for future research. This new Belgian country was tasked with creating a new state out of the seceded territory with multiple language groups. Already, one of the stark differences is that the idea of “Belgium” was created concurrently with the Belgian state. The idea of the “Confoederatio Helvetica”, even only as a mere confederation or alliance, existed for centuries before the creation of the Swiss state. The Swiss nation builders had 5 centuries of history to draw upon. Belgian history, on the other hand, is not very old, and thus, its nation-builders did not have a long, historic past to rally the people around. While, of course, the territory of Belgium had a history prior to 1830, it was often a part of a larger neighboring country, even being nicknamed the “battlefield of Europe”, and thus there was little material for the basis of *Belgian* pride. Even though the Belgian elite tried to construct a Belgian identity by creating different national symbols such as a flag, a constitution and a national hymn, these symbols were not as successful because they were novel and created for the purpose of nation-building. Even the Belgian flag was “invented” in 1830 as a modification of the French flag (although it did use the colors from the coat of arms of the Duchy of Brabant, a piece of *Belgian* history).

In *Ethnosymbolism and Nationalism: A Cultural Approach*, Anthony D. Smith observes two forms of ethno-symbolism, lateral and vertical. In lateral (aristocratic) ethnies, national identity is dispersed by the elites from the top-down. This is analogous to the way that the Belgians created their national symbolism. In vertical (demotic) ethnies, symbols and myths are already shared between the community regardless of social positions. Smith also writes that vertical ethnies “may be formed around tribal confederations…united for battle…”. Switzerland is clearly a near-perfect example of the vertical development model. It seems intuitive that symbols in a vertical ethnie would be more powerful than those in a lateral one. Indeed, Smith writes “vertical or ‘demotic’ ethnies reveal a much more intensive emotional bond between the members.”

While the differences in the methods of nation-building symbolism help explain why the Swiss had much stronger national unity than Belgium, it doesn’t explain the cause of the divisive antagonism between the language groups in Belgium. For that, we need to examine not only the history, but also the political systems of the two nations and how they dealt with linguistic diversity. To constructivists, language is simply a tool for unification but isn’t intrinsically important to national identity. However, this philosophy was interpreted in very different ways by Switzerland and Belgium. The Swiss recognized that each language was important to its speakers, and that respecting each individual language would incentivize loyalty to the nation as opposed to alienating parts of the population. Essentially, it was able to use language as a bargaining chip, something to offer local cantons independent control over in exchange for loyalty to the nation. Already at the founding of the country in 1848, the German, French, and Italian languages all saw equal status at the national level. The Belgians, on the other hand, used language as a much more active tool by forcing a common language with the hope of promoting national unity. The French-speakers, a minority in the United Kingdom of Netherlands, suddenly became a majority in the new Belgium, and used this opportunity to declare French as the national language, a decision that alienated the Flemish-speakers. Thus, Flemish became a symbol of the oppressed and the Flemish rallied around their language and “great past” of the Flemings. What began as a political movement for Flemish language equality grew into something far bigger: a nation. As the movement grew from demanding language equality, the Flemish began to demand cultural parity as well. The language evolved into more than just a language; it became an identity. Pushing for this were Flemish elites who hoped to use this identity as the basis to fulfill political goals, essentially creating a constructivist movement within Belgium, but this time, partially based around shared ethnicity, ancestry, and language.

Recognition of language is very important to people, and the French-speaking Belgian elite actively chose to not recognize Flemish when constructing the Belgian state. By the time that the Belgian government began to accept Flemish as equal to French with the Equality Law of 1898 (even this did not make Flemish equal, as there were still areas such as government and higher education where French was given preference over Flemish, even in Flanders), it was too late. The Flemish national identity had already formed. What makes the situation even worse, however, is that Belgium’s political system destroys any hope of further unification. Since the 1960s, the regions of Wallonia and Flanders have had their own autonomous regional governments that have a lot of overlap in powers with the federal government, allowing for the meteoric rise of national parties based around regional and identities. Furthermore, there is a concept of *Language Communities* in the Belgian governmental systems. By formalizing linguistic divide in the government and creating official segregation for different language groups, the Belgian political system essentially encourages regional and linguistic conflict.

This is in contrast to Switzerland’s political relationship with language, namely that it’s extremely minimal. Besides recognizing the four national languages, it takes a hands-off approach, and does not officially segregate the population or territory in the linguistic regions. This hands-off approach to not showing any sort of division or preference can be seen in the symbolic choice of Switzerland’s official name, Confoederatio Helvetica, or “Swiss Confederation” in Latin. By choosing Latin, a neutral language, the nation’s name does not symbolize a connection with any of the four national languages and doesn’t prefer one language to another. At the federal level, Switzerland uses the personality principle, allowing citizens to speak in any of the four national languages to federal authorities. At the cantonal level, Switzerland follows the territoriality principle, giving cantons the ability to choose official languages within their own borders. The Swiss Constitution states, “The Cantons shall decide on their official languages. In order to preserve harmony between linguistic communities, the Cantons shall respect the traditional territorial distribution of languages and take account of indigenous linguistic minorities.” This essentially creates many homogenous, monolingual units that combined make a large multilingual nation, but were able to live harmoniously due to the federalist separation of powers and the democratic process. When certain individual cantons see linguistic diversity within them, there are multiple ways they resolve this. First, they can choose to be a multi-lingual canton, of which there are four currently out of the 26 cantons. They can do this independently, as they have the full right to choose their language rules, including the decision to be multi-lingual. The other option is that they can choose to break up into different cantons. The canton of Jura, which was largely French-speaking, broke off from the German-speaking canton of Bern. To do this it required the consent of the entire country as it would create a new canton, but the referendum (an integral part of Swiss democracy) passed easily with close to 80% approval. This just serves as further evidence that the decentralized method of Swiss federalism works.

While Switzerland’s federalism and nation building ethno-symbolism did play a role in providing for a more cohesive society than Belgium, there are other factors that could have affected Belgium’s regional conflicts. For one, while nationalism and sociological ideas are important, another vital force behind regional conflicts in history is economics. The economic disparity between Wallonia and Flanders contributes to its instability. While Wallonia, being an industrial powerhouse, was originally much richer than Flanders, in the post-war period, Wallonia’s economy collapsed and was surpassed by Flanders which created a very successful post-industrial economic system. One of the bases that Flemish secessionists often use for justification is that the Flemish send more taxpayer money to Wallonia than they receive, essentially subsidizing the Walloons. While this does contribute to the animosity, I would claim that this is a symptom of the problem, not a cause. Economic disparity between regions is present in almost every state, even Switzerland, where the French and Italian cantons are facing higher unemployment rates than the German. In Switzerland, the people are ok with some level of subsidizing, because it is after all, going to benefit their Swiss nation. Subsidizing Wallonia causes grief to Flemish because the people they are subsidizing are Walloons; they are not bettering *their nation* of Flanders.

Furthermore, it is often suggested that external pressures played a role in heightening the conflict. Unlike Switzerland which remained essentially unharmed militarily throughout the 20th century, Belgium was destroyed by two World Wars. It is well documented that during World War II, the Nazis would urge the Flemish to create insurgencies for the purpose of destabilizing Belgium. However, the Nazis were able to do this by pulling at the strings of already existent underlying problems. As noted earlier, the Flemish had already began to feel a unique sense of nationality by the turn of the 20th century, before both world wars. Furthermore, the Flemish Movement was marred with the stigma of Nazism and remained dormant for nearly 2 decades after 1945. So if anything, the outside influence of the Nazis ended up helping sedate the Belgian conflict rather than incite it.

Switzerland and Belgium are similar in so many ways from their locations, sizes, populations, incomes, to demographics. However, the internal dynamics of these two countries could not be more different. The vast majority of Belgians, especially the Flemish, identify more with their regional identity than they do with their national one. In Switzerland, on the other hand, national and regional identities exist side by side and do not compete with each other, but rather complement each other through a federalist system. Cantonal identity encompasses language, culture and traditions, while Swiss identity is rooted in ideas such as the political rights that come with the Swiss citizenship and a sense of nationality that arose from a successful nation-building campaign using ethno-symbolism techniques.

The future for both these countries is uncertain. Belgium constantly teeters on the brink of breaking apart, held together largely by neither sides’ willingness to give up the city of Brussels (which is also the capital of the EU). Switzerland meanwhile, while almost never voting along linguistic lines in national referenda, often does so on issues regarding integration with the European Union or similar Pan-European organizations. Whether this will serve as a dividing force in the future is yet to be seen. Finally, the emergence of a new *lingua franca* on the world scene, English, is throwing a variable into play in both these countries, and it has the potential to be both a unifying force and a dividing one.

Understanding the successes of Switzerland and shortcomings of Belgium is important because it teaches us how to successfully create larger confederations or federations from diverse populations. Younger multiethnic countries such as India can learn from Switzerland’s model to create a stable federal nation. Furthermore, even supranational organizations such as the European Union can learn from Switzerland’s effective federal model in creating a successful central government while still ceding jurisdiction over areas such as language and culture to its member states. Understanding the role of nationalism in these two countries is extremely important as it can guide us on the path to being able to form successful stable and diverse alliances.

  I believe that every person should have a fair shot at achieving the American dream, but that every person’s achievement should be the product of their own work, merit, and skills. To this end, we must increase equality of opportunity and create a society where no one is discriminated against due to their race, religion, creed, or gender, but rather judged and rewarded for what they offer to their fellow man.  
  
The government’s job in such a society is to protect the people’s ability to act freely, create change, and live without fear. This means protecting their rights and liberties, and not over encroaching upon them. When the government starts controlling what people can say (which includes mass surveillance), taking from its people in order to fund its unregulated spending habits, and interfering in the economic markets beyond their right, it undermines the free society it seeks to maintain.

  It is time to amend the Electoral College. Any system that has failed 5 times out 58 is broken. Democracy should represent people, not states. If more people live in urban areas, then urban areas should have more voting power.

Besides, the electoral college doesn’t shift attention away from “big” states to “small” states. It simply shifts them to a few “battleground states”. We can fix this. It doesn’t even need a Constitutional Amendment. It could be done with the agreement of enough states with over 50% of the electoral college voting power. Check out the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact).

  Experience from a friend on Election Day 2016:

> “I spent all day campaigning outside the polls. This isn’t unusual, I’m always involved with some kind of political cause or candidate. What WAS unusual was the sort of people who turned out to vote in this election. I usually see a lot of retirees, government employees, and white-collar workers. This time, though, was a completely different crowd. They showed up covered in drywall dust or smelling like fertilizer, wearing Carhartt jackets and mechanics’ coveralls. They drove their big rigs and pickups right up to the poll and asked how to vote because they weren’t familiar with the process. The crowd today was unmistakably composed of pissed-off, working-class white people, and they turned up in huge numbers.”  In the study of the French Revolution, the common narrative pushed by the “nation-in-arms” school attributes the success of the French army to their numerical superiority and enthusiasm of its soldiers due to the righteousness of their cause. However, the analysis is not universally accepted by all historians. In his essay “Evolution or Revolution on the Battlefield?”, Jordan R. Hayworth challenges this traditional interpretation by suggesting that factors such as evolutionary military tactics, disciplined soldiers, and effective commanders played a far more decisive role than soldier morale in the the victories of the French Army. Meanwhile, T.C.W. Blanning in his book, “The French Revolutionary Wars” takes a more nuanced analysis, suggesting that both morale and Hayworth’s factors could have both played important roles in the success of the army. In fact, he even argues that soldier morale may be the underlying cause of many of the the factors Hayworth cites, and thus even if morale didn’t play a direct correlation with fighting proficiency, it impacted the French army in many other ways. Through an analysis of the works of Hayworth and Blanning, I will argue that although Blanning’s analysis of multiple variables creates an effective framework for studying the French army’s success, pitting Hayworth’s skepticism against Blanning’s arguments exposes some areas where Blanning may over attribute the role of soldier morale in the French army’s successes during the French Revolution.

The primary evidence Blanning presents to demonstrate the direct effect of soldier morale upon the success of the French military is largely anecdotal, focusing primarily on the battle of Valmy. It was this battle, that the military commander Kellermann, famously led his severely outnumbered army into battle with a resounding cry of “Vive la nation!” and “scared” the Prussians into stopping in their tracks. And while this cherry-picked example is a great story, this one impressive display of morale is not enough to assert that morale was the primary direct factor in the French successes across numerous battles. Blanning recognizes this and offers evidence that suggests other possible factors at play in the French victory at Valmy. He writes, “On the slopes in front of them [the Prussians] stood not the demoralised rabble they had been led to expect, but rank upon rank of well-disciplined and well-armed soldiers, commanded by men who clearly knew what they were about.” Blanning uses this opportunity to explore the Prussian’s surprise as to the numbers of French army, and how they were falsely misled by the emigres (not necessarily intentionally) to believe that “the Revolution was confined to a dwindling band of fanatics in the capital and that elsewhere the good people of France were only waiting for the arrival of the allies to declare their loyalty to the Crown”, when in reality, the French had a much larger force ready at their disposal than expected. Blanning’s assertion that the Prussians were unprepared to be fighting such a well-armed army with such effective leadership fits directly with the argument Hayworth puts forward in stressing “the role of training and discipline in creating a viable combat force from an army of ‘citizen-soldiers’”.

Regardless of whether it was the higher than expected numbers or better disciplined numbers that shocked the Prussians, the fact remains that the lack of information of the side of the Prussians severely contributed to their decision to stop their attack. The Battle of Valmy is not some stunning example of how the patriotism in the hearts of the French soldier made them fight with the strength of two Prussians, rather it just exemplifies the lack of preparation on the side of the allies. Blanning writes later, “Lack of numbers was also due to a lack of focus…In 1792 their [Austria and Prussia’s] attention was directed as much at Poland as it was at France for the equally volatile situation there involved their interests more directly.” Blanning uses this to suggest that the events in Poland heavily distracted Austria and subsequently Prussia from putting their full force in dealing with the French problem in its early stages. Along with fighting France “with one eye on events in the east and with one hand tied behind their backs”, the Polish situation had another important effect of the allies; it divided them. The situation in Poland pitted Austria and Prussia on opposite sides, both vying to grab a larger slice of the partitioned Poland. This invigorated decades-old animosity between the two states, an animosity that found its way even to the lowest levels of the armies in France. At one point there was even a question as to whether Prussia would switch to allying with France. This animosity caused distrust within the allied army, greatly reducing its effectiveness as Austrians and Prussians would not cooperate to the greatest extent.

One thing that Hayworth does, largely due to his background as a historian, is he effectively looks at and analyzes multiple battles in great detail when creating his case. What one notices when reading his piece is that two years after the 1792 Battle of Valmy, in 1794, once the allies realized the magnitude of the threat that France posed and directed their efforts in this direction, they were able to defeat the allies in numerous battles and put up a strong resistance. Hayworth does not paint the French army as an unstoppable force that was incapable of defeat, but rather presents the full story of the French campaign in both its ups and downs. Blanning briefly notes this as well writing that “The belief that it was revolutionary elan that brought victory also seems problematic when one considers the inconsistent pattern of success… campaigns of 1792. 1793 and 1794…were anything but constant, being rather a bewildering zigzag of success and failure.” The two authors both agree that this evidence contradicts the assertion that the revolutionary spirit was the sole contributor in the French successes, as it is nonsensical to believe that the somehow the soldier’s revolutionary spirit waxed and waned from day to day, leading to the non-constant battle outcomes.

In fact, through the four battles that the Sambre and Meuse Army fought in 1794, what we see is that the French started off losing the first battle and then getting consecutively better. This would seem quite odd if you were to buy that the morale of the soldier led to the victory of the French. Typically, soldier morale tends to start at an high with enthusiastic soldiers wanting to fight for a cause but then decreases as wars drag on. It is thus quite odd that the French seemed to be getting better after every battle. The much more plausible explanation that Hayworth presents is that the increasing success was due to evolutionary methodologies where after each battle, the originally inept French volunteer army became more experienced and the commanders learned from mistakes in previous battles in order to improve. The early volunteer section of the army was a highly unorganized force. Even at the romanticized Battle of Valmy, General Biron said of them, “The volunteers of the most recent levy are more trouble than they are worth. All the generals to whom I wish to allocate them are afraid of them rather than keen to have them.” This largely civilian force only became an effective force due to the training and experience they got over time.

Despite their initial setbacks in the later campaigns, the French army did eventually triumph. Even Hayworth, while touting the importance of the advanced French military tactics, admits that the French superiority in numbers did heavily impact their military victories. And while it would incorrect to claim that nationalism did not play a role in recruiting soldiers, its role is often grossly overstated. In 1791 and 1792, often only a third to a half of “volunteers” ever actually reported for duty. While the volunteers boosted numbers on paper, their effect on the actual fighting force of the army was much smaller than commonly thought. However, what changed was in August of 1793, the French government mandated universal conscription, creating the largest military force Europe had ever seen. Within one year, the size of the army was nearly triple what it had been in February of 1793. Unlike at Valmy where they were outnumbered, the French now had the ability to overpower the allies with numbers, such as what they did at the Battle of the Ourthe (once again, the allies underestimated the size of the French army, pointing to how unorganized they were). However, this mass recruitment was not in the same vein as is not the same vein as the glorified “volunteer corps” of 1792; it was caused by forced conscription rather than revolutionary zeal in the citizenry. Given the political climate of the Terror in 1794, soldiers and especially commanders feared for their life if they comply or even if they were ineffective. A citizen-soldier is not really that different from a slave-soldier when they’re mandated to fight under the threat of the guillotine.

Furthermore, this propagated myth of the citizen-soldier vs the slave-soldier, seems suspiciously like a case of self-aggrandizing on the part of the post-war French. To write off the allies as demoralized soldiers that did not put up a fight, is absurd. While, the war started with France on the defensive, by the end, the French were the aggressors, and to think the allies would not fight valiantly to repel the invaders is naive. As Hayworth wrote, “Expectations of victory against demoralized ‘slave-soldiers’ proved illusory against reality on the battlefield”. Thinking that the French won due to their passion highly disservices the allies and is likely the product of revisionist history aiming to sell the Revolutionary Wars as the triumph of the French moral superiority.

After thorough analysis of both Blanning and Hayworth’s writing on the topic, it becomes clear that while nationalism played a role in the French successes during the Revolutionary Wars, the events cannot be studied in their entirety without looking at the many other variables at play. By using this framework, Blanning and Hayworth both reject the very deterministic model of warfare where the victor is decided solely by the side with numerical superiority without regard for the more complex tactics at play on the battlefield. Where Hayworth contends with Blanning is that he does not try to seek out nationalism as the root cause for many of the France’s advantages in the war, but rather prefers to analyze more nuanced factors such as military tactics and disciplined soldiers. This does bring to light some of the areas such as recruitment of soldiers, relative morale of the French and the allies, and army discipline where Blanning may over attribute the role of nationalism. Together, Blanning’s and Hayworth’s approaches to recognizing the multiple factors at play during the wars is an important tool for how we study history. It’s important to recognize that the ‘nation-in-arms’ school came about in the late 1860s in response to the defeat of the French by the Prussians as very Marxist solution to reforming the military. While it is nice to reminisce that your victories were won through sheer will and motivation, this is dangerous as it could have dedicated efforts towards revitalizing the revolutionary spirit instead of the evolutionary military reforms that were needed at the time. Understanding the nation-in-arms school of thought can also play an important role in the origins of the heightened militarism in the late 19th century that ultimately culminated in the First World War.

  The Dark Knight remains not only my favorite Nolan movie, but my favorite movie of all time. Both Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne and Aaron Eckhart’s Two-Face were absolutely amazing, however they wane in comparison to Heath Ledger’s brilliant portrayal of the Joker.

Even recently, Christian Bale admitted, “Heath turned up, and just kind of completely ruined all my plans because I went, ‘He’s so much more interesting than me and what I’m doing.’” The utter success of the Joker in this film is a combination of the writers’ genius in creating such a twisted maniac character and Heath Ledger’s ability to bring this character to life on the screen.

First, I will explore some of the writing choices that made The Dark Knight’s Joker so intriguing. Staying true to the comics which never reveal the Joker’s identity (until Justice League #50 at least), in the Dark Knight, the Joker never reveals his true origins, coming up with numerous false stories that he recounts to different characters throughout the film. However, despite this, he comes out as one of the most intriguing characters in film.

What make The Dark Knight’s Joker such a perfect villain is that he is so similar yet so diametrically opposed to Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is the only villain that truly understands Batman and how to defeat him. One of the key monologues of the Jokers is when he is in the hospital and tells Harvey Dent that he’s a man without a plan. This is the key to defeating the Batman. Batman is a genius that can outsmart his opponents. However, the Joker realizes, if you don’t have a plan, there’s nothing to outplan.

Also, his motives, villainous for sure, are pure. By not craving money, power, or anything tangible, he has no weak points. I think there are some very interesting parallels between the Joker in The Dark Knight and V from V for Vendetta. Like V, the Joker chooses to simply be the embodiment of an idea, chaos. To Dent, he says, “Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I am agent of chaos.” The Joker’s goal is to show that this sense of justice that the Batman introduced to Gotham is absurd, and the Joker’s goal is simply to destroy this belief in the hearts of the people. We, the people of Gotham and the viewers alike, like to believe we are morally upright. But the Joker was right. Would we bat an eye when we hear that a group of soldiers was blown to smithereens?

What makes this villainy so successful is its realism. Unlike other Superhero movies, the fate of the world and all humanity isn’t at stake. Even in the other two films in the trilogy, if Batman fails, the entire city of Gotham is done for. Any for that reason, we as a viewer know that everything will be all right in the end. But what’s at stake in the climax of The Dark Knight? 2 ships full of people. Something could very well happen. Throughout the entire scene, you were worried about what was going to happen. But not only were you scared for the lives of the people on the boats (we’d already seen hospitals get blown up), we were worried for the soul of Gotham and in our entire hope for the nature of humanity. And that, I don’t think any other superhero movie has pulled off.

The Joker, being a brilliant mind, knows that the only way to beat the incorruptible Batman is to corrupt him. If he can show that even the Batman isn’t perfect, Gotham will realize that this perfect right and wrong is an illusion. So to break the Batman, he needed to get the Batman to break his only rule, “Do not kill.” And to do this, he made it necessary for him to be killed; the only way to beat him was to kill him. And thus you get his point about “when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.” Because the Batman will not kill the Joker, the Joker loses but leaves him to fight another day. And thus, the Batman and the Joker engage in this never ending war for the soul of Gotham.

While the Joker is perfectly written, it would have been all for naught if Heath couldn’t deliver on the screen. But deliver he did. Ledger pulled off one of the most spectacular performances ever on film. Everything from his facial tics to his adlibbed scenes, adds to his realism. Despite Ledger’s amazing performance, his untimely death definitely did play a role in eternalizing and mythologizing this role. “He died for this role.” Many believe that it is this role, that drove him to depression. Unlike Jared Leto who used a technique called method acting to prepare for the Joker in Suicide Squad, Heath Ledger could transition between the psychotic Joker and the kind-hearted Heath Ledger, almost at will. Ledger’s makeup artist, John Caglione Jr, sad the following about Ledger, “He’d come in and give us big hugs in the morning, that’s one thing that always happened. He always was in good humor. Never lost it or anything like that. Never was mean to anyone.” Coglione even describes days where Ledger would be skateboarding around the studio in full makeup.

However, this of course is only how the public saw him. It is well known that Ledger kept something nicknamed the “Joker Diary” that helped him get mentally psyched up for filming. In this diary, he’d keep records of horrifying news stories such as school shootings in order to get him into the twisted mindset needed for the Joker. It is quite possible that while Ledger never let it show on the outside, the psychological damage of the role was hitting him on the inside. Perhaps his depression was caused by the role. Along with Nolan, we must remember Ledger as one of the true heroes of modern film. Nolan’s masterpiece Dark Knight simply wouldn’t have worked without him.

  Common analyses of 19th century European colonialism tend to focus on the effects colonialism had on the colonized regions and peoples. Meanwhile, the analysis of the reverse, the effect of the perception of the colonies on the metropole, is not nearly as often discussed. The “colonial experience” of Great Britain in managing its massive empire had some pretty far-reaching impacts on the British understandings of their own metropolitan society. During the height of its colonial empire in the 19th century, Britain went through a number of major social reforms, the abolition of slavery, increasing care for the impoverished in England, and the beginnings of a women’s suffrage movement. While internal forces within Britain had significant impact on these movements, it’s colonial experience, as perceived by a portion of its population, helped push the mindset needed to enact these changes. British exceptionalism, cemented in the national mindset by its colonial experience, entailed elevating the living conditions of British citizens both in order to exert moral superiority and to differentiate its citizens from its colonial subjects, which led to the egalitarian and liberal thinking on issues such as poverty, women’s suffrage, and prostitution.

The British have historically seen themselves as different even from other European nations, possibly stemming from their geographic isolation, being an island separated from the rest of the continent. With this came a sense of superiority, magnified in the 19th century through a number of reasons including Britain’s key role in stopping Napoleon[[1]](#_ftn1) and its relative ability to avoid the political upheavals unlike other European states. In fact, part of the British people’s justification in superiority comes from their propensity to solve issues through reform rather than revolution, something that can be seen throughout the liberal reforms of the 19th century.[[2]](#_ftn2) Along with these other causes, Britain’s colonial empire was a major source of British exceptionalism. It’s ability to amass the largest empire the world had ever seen, spanning a quarter of the world’s land area, from an island smaller than most of its holdings was cause for great pride in many British people. This idea can be seen in Joesph Salter’s writings. Being a Christian missionary in London, his job was to evangelize and Anglicize immigrants including “negros” and “asiatics”, essentially “sell” the idea of British exceptionalism, making his writing a prime example demonstrating this belief.[[3]](#_ftn3) In a part of his chapter “The Central Africans” from his book The East in the West, he writes about a time when a negro relayed to him “African’s perception of England”, saying: “‘You are a wonderful people…You live in a little island in the sea and you rule India and Africa. All the world serves you and sends you its product…’”[[4]](#_ftn4) It is unlikely that this was the universal opinion on England of all Africans, or likely even the majority. However, given that Salter was an English writer writing to an English population, the fact that he chose this example, does more to demonstrate the English view of themselves and what they want Africans to view them as. Salter continues relaying the African’s praise, “‘If we put iron into the water it sinks to the bottom; but you make it carry your men and merchandise across the widest sea. We are afraid of the wind and the lighting, but you use them both: the wind drives your ships wherever you want to go, and the lightning carries your messages over the houses and under the sea…”[[5]](#_ftn5) The British have a desire to be seen as superior, and the stark differences in quality of life between Britain and their colonized territories further entrench this mindset.

Britain was undoubtedly the most capable military power and powerful economic force in the world, far surpassing all of its colonies. Yet within England, there was a high level of inequality; not all Englishmen necessary enjoyed the benefits of their nation’s economic position. While inequality was nothing new, the 19th century saw many strides towards reforms directed at addressing it such as the Poor Laws. General William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, writes in his book In Darkest England and the Way Out a response to and in the style of Henry Stanley’s Through the Dark Continent. In this piece, Booth pits Stanley’s recount of the lives of the impoverished of Africa to the lives of the impoverished on London, writing “May we find a parallel at our own doors, and discover within a stone’s throw of our cathedrals and palaces similar horror to those which Stanley has found existing in the great Equatorial forest?”[[6]](#_ftn6) He then later goes on to recount an “expedition” into the heart of the poorest parts of London, getting the personal accounts of the beggars who litter the streets, in order to appeal to the ethos of his reader. Booth is implying that poverty conditions in London are not too far off from those in Africa. Given Booth’s position as the General of the Salvation Army, his goal is not only to raise awareness but also to increase engagement in the active fight against poverty. For this reason, it is likely that he is appealing to the British Exceptionalism in the mindset of his British readers in order to convince them to take action against poverty in England in order to distinguish it from the uncivilized Africa. Due to the prominence of the Salvation Army at this time, Booth was able to spread this message and reach many people.

While Booth was able to use his position and powerful organization to spread this notion of using social superiority to motivate poverty elimination, this idea was not novel when he wrote about it in 1890. Thomas Carlyle, despite approaching it as a more antagonistic attack on the negroes in the colonies, still ends up making a similar appeal as Booth in his essay “Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question” as early as 1849. He writes, “The British Whites are rather badly off; several millions of them hanging on the verge of continual famine…” while sarcastically remarking that they can take solace in the fact that “the Negros are all very happy and doing well.” He is trying incite anger in his reader, by reminding them of how “unfair” it is that the they are going through hardships while blacks in the West Indies are happy and have it easy. However, Carlyle’s intentions are a bit different than Booth’s; while Booth’s goal was to use the British exceptionalism to encourage care for the poor, Carlyle is simply using it to incite anger in order to push his proposal, which is largely economic in reason. Carlyle wishes to use the West Indies and the black labor there to produce “useful crops” for the British like sugar, spices, and coffee instead of the pumpkins that the blacks were sustaining off of. Carlyle attempts to garner resentment in the British reader against this pumpkin subsistence by once again comparing it to the rough conditions at home, writing “Blacks sitting there up to the ears in pumpkins, and doleful Whites sitting here without potatoes to eat.”[[7]](#_ftn7) It could be argued that like Booth, Carlyle also has plans to use the colonies to alleviate the economic issues at home, however, Carlyle’s strategy is far more hands on. While Booth suggests simply improving the lives of the poor in England to distinguish them from the colonies, Carlyle suggests an active suppression of quality of life in the colonies in the form of forced labor in order to do useful work that will economically benefit England, potentially helping the poor, while also making the English seem better off by comparison.

Along with the conditions for the poor, there are other issues that highlight the dichotomy in liberalism in the metropole and in the colonies. One such case is the question of prostitution. Booth in his piece writes about prostitution in London, “A young penniless girl, if she be pretty, is often hunted from pillar to post by her employers, confronted always by the alternative–Starve or Sin…The blood [of people] boils with impotent rage at the sight of these enormities, callously inflicted, and silently borne by these miserable victims. Nor is it only women who are the victims, although their fate is the most tragic.”[[8]](#_ftn8) It is clear that in this appeal, Booth expects a reaction of disgust from the reader. While he doesn’t directly make a call for action, he implies that a large number of people believe that these injustices should be stopped. He later goes on the explain why poverty reduction will solve these issues.

Meanwhile, the reactions to the regulated system of forced prostitution that the British army set up in India were very different. Elizabeth Andrew and Katharine Bushnell write in The Queen’s Daughters in India about their travels to India in order to expose this unjust practice. What comes across clearly from their experience is that the British in India clearly have a different reaction to the type Booth suggests the British in Britain do. The British soldiers seem to display a sense of indifference to the abuse that the women go through and even play an active role in creating the abusive system. Although it is important to note, that a comparison of these reactions to those that Booth describes is somewhat unfair, as it is comparing the perspectives of general society to those of the army soldiers who benefit directly from the practice. However, Andrew and Bushnell also relay the legend, “After that experience she [a high-born lady] sought opportunity to talk with high military officials concerning the necessity of protecting high-born ladies from such risks, by furnishing opportunities for sensual indulgence to the British soldiers, and the result was the elaboration and extension of a system for the apportionment of native women to regiments.” While this story is only a tradition, it does point to the fact that the British general society in India was complicit in the creation of the prostitution rings as a way to help protect themselves.

Furthermore, differences in attitude can also be seen in the reactions of the missionaries. These liberal reformers, despite being personally angered with this, don’t attempt to reason with the soldiers or destroy the practice by appealing to morality.[[9]](#_ftn9) Rather, the best their efforts can do are see if there are any ways they can make the lives for the women more bearable. This dichotomy in care for the welfare of women in England and in India is seen even more clearly in the writings of other feminists at the time. Antoinette D. Burton, in her journal article British Feminists and Indian Women 1865–1915, notes that in the later part of the 19th century, many British feminists shared prevailing views of British/White superiority and that a sense of female and white superiority helped many Victorian feminists to claim the ‘Anglo-Saxon woman’ as the most evolved female type — many assumed a hierarchy of civilization according to perceived status of women within that culture — and thus much more deserving of emancipation than Indian women.[[10]](#_ftn10) This shows that even liberal reformers valued the welfare of British women over that of Indian and other colonial women.

Along with maintaining superiority over its colonies socially by making sure its citizens’ living conditions were better than those in its colonies, England’s supremacy also required a form of moral superiority over its colonies and its neighbors. This is in part due to its necessity in the justification of a “civilizing mission.” If England’s rationalization for colonization is bringing morality and civilization to the the colonized people, it needs to be more moral and civilized than its colonies. Evidence of British pride in moral superiority can be seen in Booth’s piece where he writes, “England emancipated her negroes sixty years ago, at a cost of £40,000,000, and has never ceased boasting about it since.”[[11]](#_ftn11) This shows, that the British did value moral superiority and saw it as a source of pride, even if it had economic cost.

One example of Britain pushing more liberal mindsets for this purpose is in the emergence of women’s rights movements. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a prominent British feminist, in her piece “The Woman’s Suffrage Bill” writes “Nothing astonishes Orientals more than the position of women in England…Another Eastern, Syed Ahmed Khan, was amazed to find that the servant-girl who waited upon him in a lodging in London could read and write.”[[12]](#_ftn12) Here, Fawcett in order to appeal to the English ego, brings up multiple occasions where foreigners were amazed to the ways in which the English already treated their women. She continues describing Khan’s reaction, “He recorded his deliberate opinion that the little scrub in the London lodging…was in reality superior in nearly all respects to Indian ladies of the highest rank.”[[13]](#_ftn13) Like, with Salter’s description of the Central African’s praise, Fawcett’s cherry picked example is reflective of what she and other English want foreigners to think of them. This message is similar to the one that inspired aid for the poor; the English men need to give rights to their women (in Fawcett’s case, women’s suffrage) as to distinguish their women and make themselves superior to “the savages” in how they treat their women.

Along with being moral superior to its colonies, England also had a desire to be morally superior to its European peers, especially its imperial rival, France. Being morally superior to France is vital to justifying the British civilizing mission as “more civilizing” than France’s civilizing mission. Another of the many arguments Fawcett uses to push her agenda, is that granting women’s suffrage is a way to “one up” France. She writes, “But women’s suffrage is not even heard of in France; it does not exist there as a practical political subject. One of Gambetta’s sayings in contrasting the political situations of England and France, was to the effect that England had the advantage of France in this respect, that here the enfranchisement of women was possible and desirable, while in his own country, it was entirely out of the question.”[[14]](#_ftn14) Fawcett implies that the opportunity to adopt women’s suffrage before France is an opportunity for England to exert moral superiority over its rival, something the English were always keen to do.

Through an analysis of writings of contemporaries such as Thomas Carlyle, General William Booth, Joseph Salter, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and Elizabeth Andrew, evidence emerges suggesting an interesting narrative in which Britain’s experience in colonial expansion in combination with its desire for national superiority led to support for liberal reforms, especially in the areas of poverty reduction and women’s rights. Many social activists used appeals to the national ego and the desire to be morally and culturally superior to Britain’s colonies in order to convince the British people to take a more active interest in the welfare of its citizens, even the poor and women. This relationship between national ego and liberalism is an interesting phenomenon. While the era of the British empire may be over, national exceptionalism still exists, especially in the United States of America, and understanding it can allow us to direct its energies towards progressive policies to benefit people rather than politics of hate.

  Today, the “superhero origin story” has become a tired formula, often seen as cliched and unoriginal ([Why is Every Superhero Movie an Origin Story?](http://www.ew.com/article/2012/12/12/origin-stories-man-of-steel-superman)).However, one origin story seems to stand out from the crowd, sometimes even ranked higher than its universally acclaimed sequel. Batman Begins is often described by many as the “definitive origin story”. To understand why this is, we need to take a look at the context behind it’s inception (NOlan Pun intended).  
  
When Batman Begins first hit cinemas in 2005, it was the first Batman movie in eight years. The previous big-screen installment in the franchise was the disastrous Batman & Robin, after which no one wanted to touch the Batman “trainwreck” for nearly a decade. Therefore, when Nolan suggested to recreate the entire series from scratch and create a new universe, one more gritty and dark than its predecessor, Warner Bros was all on board. While, in retrospect, this seems trivial, this was actually a pretty risky move. While continuity was much more fluid in comics and reboots common, this simply was not common in the film industry. Batman Begins was a trailblazer in this regard of keeping audiences engaged while presenting them with a story they likely already knew.  
  
To do this, Nolan had to do something new with Batman Begins, something unseen in the superhero film world. The years leading up to 2005 were filled with a slew of superhero flops with the likes of Daredevil, Hulk, and Hellboy. What he realized was that even the more successful superhero films of the time like Spiderman and X-Men focused on large battles between the superhero and his enemies. Batman Begins, on the other hand, shifts the focus away from the “Big Bad” (although this does cause “underdeveloped villains” to be a common critique of the movie) and becomes more about what’s really at the root of origin stories: the transformation of a man into something more, a superhero. Batman Begins truly paints Batman not as a character, but rather a persona of Bruce Wayne. And isn’t that what an origin story should be about? The origin of Batman. The forces at play in making a tortured billionaire put on a mask to fight his perceived injustice.  
  
While superhero film industry is very different than it was 11 years, somehow we as an audience (at least most of us) are still attracted to the compelling origin story. And a lot of the truly great ones definitely find their inspiration in the standard that Batman Begins set. And those that don’t, could have a lot to learn from it (I’m looking at you, Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman).

  Insomnia is often considered the forgotten Nolan film. Besides, some minor revisions on the final script, Nolan had no part in the making of the story. In fact, Insomnia is Nolan’s only film in which he doesn’t have any writing credits whatsoever. Being the director, many elements of Nolan’s style do, of course, impact the cinematography of the film, especially his focus on objects and usage of cinematography to reflect characters’ mental states. However, what doesn’t feel “Nolan-esque” is the plot. Nolan’s films are well known for their plot twists, something that is noticeably missing. Nothing is really kept from the audience. The audience and the main character both learn the identity of the killer very early on in the movie. Expanding on this, Nolan films tend to have a focus on the nature of lies. Insomnia does have a focus on this, but once again, it doesn’t have the same feel to it that his other works do, largely because of the constant omniscience of the audience. Beyond twists, Nolan films also tend to end with a sense of uncertainty. Some part of the plot is not revealed to the audience, often regarding some aspect of the morality of the main character. However, in this film, interestingly, Nolan does the opposite. In the original Norwegian film, the “accidental nature” of the the main character’s shooting of his partner is left much more vague, largely how it is acted on in the fog scene. However, in Nolan’s remake, from the reaction of the character in that scene, it seems to be beyond reasonable doubt that the shooting was in fact an accident. Insomnia is definitely the most different of Nolan’s films, but it was a necessary stepping stone for his foray into big studio production. Without having to focus on plot, Nolan was able to focus his efforts into showing his prowess in film style and demonstrate his ability to work with a large budget and with A-level actors.
