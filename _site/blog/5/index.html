<!-- I was sitting in my first EE16A discussion when as an icebreaker we had to write group stories. I was trying to come up with an idea, but was at a loss for words…

I looked around and saw that somehow my class had turned into a zoo. The students transformed into various animals…

The girl next to me had transformed into a penguin while my TA snarled at me in a ferocious tiger form. Luckily…

I had taken an animal fighting Decal the semester before, so I knew exactly what to do. The first step according to my class was…

to go up to the tiger and offer it a tuna sandwich. Ever since that day, we heave been best friends who go on toboggan rides in the winter and discuss philosophy in an easy to under, comic-like format.

![](/images/medium/0*RYbBkFAOT0KFsr01.jpg){: .center-image .hero }As politicians and environmentalists are clamoring about energy sustainability, very few people are the ones actually taking the initiative to make a difference. There is a lot of rhetoric being thrown around in campaign ads and on the floors of our legislative bodies, but the undeniable reality of the situation is that recognizing the problem is not enough, that we must be working to solve the problem. One such innovator that is actually actively pushing a solution to our dire energy situation is Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity. Musk, an avid environmentalist, believes that energy sustainability is one of the cornerstones of pushing the human race forward and he believes that the best way for us to actively move towards a more sustainable society is to to make the switch from our gasoline guzzling automobiles towards the efficient electric cars. Our nation, drunk on oil as it is, will only be able to push self-sufficiency and renewable energy when it first achieves sobriety from our addiction. As a sponsor offers aid and an exitway to the alcoholic, Elon Musk is offering us an escape from our dependence, the ability to cut ourselves off from gasoline completely, the completely electric car. However, it is up to us, the people, the stubborn change-resistant people, to accept the salvation. In order to change the public’s perception of electric cars, Elon Musk designed one of the most sleek, and technologically-advanced cars (in short attractive to the consumer) cars to show that electric cars don’t have to be the boxy, unattractive vehicles created in the past by other manufacturers. Musk himself write, “It is designed with the aspiration of not simply being the best electric car, but being the best car of any kind,” (Musk, “[The Tesla Approach](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/tesla-approach-distributing-and-servicing-cars)”). On numerous occasions he makes sure to exemplify the traditional car aspects of the Tesla cars that consumers value such as:


> Car & Driver assessed the Roadster as having the best 30 to 70 mph acceleration of any car they tested in 2007 (and possibly ever), and that’s where I really notice the difference…No need to think about downshifting and getting your rpm into the torque sweet spot — you’re always in the torque sweet spot with an electric car…Try to do that on a Viper or a Porsche Carrera GT and you’ll burn out your clutch within a week and destroy your rear tires. (Musk, “Driving P1”).and “Model S also has the largest automotive touchscreen in the world and the ability to add new features and capabilities over the air, just like your computer or mobile phone,”
> 
> (Musk, “The Tesla Approach”).

Even though the Tesla Model S has turned many heads throughout the country, gaining national media coverage and awards, Elon Musk’s greatest challenge continues to be the nation of hardheaded Americans who are resistant to change. There has been a lot of opposition against Tesla from numerous sources and for varying reasons including environmental impact, safety, Tesla’s business model. To further convince the American people of the viability of electric cars, Elon Musk has taken to popular media sources and the Tesla Motors Blog to use his rhetoric in attempts to speak out in defense of Tesla and its motives.

As reducing the environmental impact is the ultimate goal of Tesla cars, one of Elon Musk’s primary rhetorical strategies is to appeal to the pathos of his readers by stressing the environmental benefits of the electric cars as he claimed “…The overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution,” (Musk, “The Secret Tesla Motors Plan”).

One of the most common arguments that opponents often argue against Tesla is the “Longer Tail-Pipe Argument.” They claim that using electric cars does not in reality help solve the carbon emissions as it just pushes the carbon burning from the car to the power plant. Elon Musk directly counters this abuse by pointing out the fallacy in the argument because of the fact that the opponent assumes that the electric power plant is using the same source of energy as the gasoline car. Electric generators, unlike internal combustion engines, are not limited to oil as a source of energy; they can use numerous sources with less carbon footprint such as solar, hydro, wind, nuclear, and geothermal. To impress this fact in the reader’s mind, he devises an anaphora: “a world 100% full of Prius drivers is still 100% addicted to oil,” (Musk, “The Secret Tesla Motors Plan”).

But if this still does not convince the naysayers, Musk proceeds to be the devil’s advocate and assumes that the power plants use nothing but fossil fuels. He responds that:


> The H-System Combined Cycle Generator from General Electric is 60% efficient in turning natural gas into electricity. “Combined Cycle” is where the natural gas is burned to generate electricity and then the waste heat is used to create steam that powers a second generator. Natural gas recovery is 97.5% efficient, processing is also 97.5% efficient and then transmission efficiency over the electric grid is 92% on average. This gives us a well-to-electric-outlet efficiency of 97.5% x 97.5% x 60% x 92% = 52.5%…Bringing the math together, we get the final figure of merit of 2.53 km/MJ x 86% x 52.5% = 1.14 km/MJ
> 
> (Musk, “The Secret Tesla Motors Plan”).

He continues on with similar terminology for an additional 2 paragraphs. These technical paragraphs have a double purpose. First, for the opponents who cry out the Longer Tailpipe Argument, proves that the argument is bogus using math, statistics, and chemistry. This appeal to logos, is an effective one that essentially puts the environmental issue of electric cars to rest once and for all. Then, for the audience, those that are impartial on the issue coming in, he attempts to use an appeal to ethos to his advantage. He increases his credibility by making it seem that he is intelligent (I am not implying that he is not) by “bombing” the reader with statistics and scientific “jargon.” He further backs up his claims with an appeal to ethos by citing Stanford graduates that he got data from, using the Stanford name and the value of name-brand recognition it carries in our society to his advantage. Regardless of whether his audience understands the science behind the calculations, they can still recognize them as being scientific in nature, increasing Musk’s credibility (Musk, “The Secret Tesla Motors Plan”). This form of presenting the information is useful as it is effective against multiple audiences instead of just directed at one. He reuses the same strategy in numerous blog posts, another notable one being the one in which he explains why ethanol is not an alternative to electric cars. In this post, he writes:


> Let’s consider the specific example of the United States vs. Brazil (production is taken from the Oil & Gas Journal and consumption from the BP Statistical Review, 2002 data). Oil consumption in the US is 27 barrels per person per year (BPY) vs. 4.2 BPY in Brazil, but the US also produces more oil at 11 BPY vs. Brazil at 3.35 BPY. Therefore, Brazil has to close a gap of 0.85 BPY, whereas the US has to close a gap of 16 BPY, resulting in a per person supply/demand imbalance 19 times greater than that of Brazil! Moreover, the US has a population 50% greater than Brazil, but has less arable land and a shorter growing cycle. If the US had the same per person oil usage as Brazil, it would be a major oil exporter. This is why the “Brazilian Miracle” is still limited to Brazil (Musk, “Ethanol, Ethanol Everywhere”).Once again, the strategy Musk employs is essentially the same. To satisfy those who actually understand the information he presents, his logic is sound and he calls upon a reliable source for his data in order to maintain his credibility. To the more casual reader, his technical jargon, despite being economics rather than science this time, achieves the same effect of overwhelming the reader in a way that he feels compelled to assume that what they are reading is so complex that it must be correct. He further enhances his own credibility when talking about the efficiency of ethanol vs Solar Panels, claiming “Another way to think about the problem is that plants are essentially just a very inefficient way to convert sunlight into stored chemical energy. Crops typically have a net efficiency of about 1/2% or so, compared with commercially available photovoltaics at 20%” in effect promoting his other company SolarCity, by appealing to the reader’s ethos by once again calling upon numerous University names that are regarded as prestigious in our society: “From a discussion I had with Prof. Nate Lewis at CalTech” and “There is an excellent paper by Pimentel, a professor at Cornell, and Patzek, a prof at Berkeley…”
> 
> (Musk, “Ethanol, Ethanol Everywhere”).

While Musk recognizes the importance of the environmental impact of a car, he recognizes clearly that the primary concern of vehicle buyers is safety. Musk uses his knowledge of what his audience values to his advantage. When responding to the fires that occurred in Tesla cars, he recognized that safety is something that the average consumer values far more than specific environmental concerns, and so he used far less jargon than he did in the environmental sections, as seen in these quotes:


> Had a conventional gasoline car encountered the same object on the highway, the result could have been far worse. A typical gasoline car only has a thin metal sheet protecting the underbody, leaving it vulnerable to destruction of the fuel supply lines or fuel tank, which causes a pool of gasoline to form and often burn the entire car to the ground. In contrast, the combustion energy of our battery pack is only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank and is divided into 16 modules with firewalls in between. As a consequence, the effective combustion potential is only about 1% that of the fuel in a comparable gasoline sedan
> 
> (Musk, “Model S Fire”).

and

> Since the Model S went into production last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries (extrapolating [2012 NFPA data](http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/Files/Research/Fact%20sheets/FireLossFacts.pdf)). However, the three Model S fires, which only occurred after very high-speed collisions and caused no serious injuries or deaths, received more national headlines than all 250,000+ gasoline fires combined. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly. Reading the headlines, it is therefore easy to assume that the Tesla Model S and perhaps electric cars in general have a greater propensity to catch fire than gasoline cars when nothing could be further from the truth (Musk, “The Mission of Tesla”).

In these situations, he uses only an appeal to logos to convince the public that the car is safer than gasoline cars. He explains the situation in simple English, while still maintaining the facts, without dissolving into technical jargon as he did in the environmental articles because the topic is far more solemn and important to the average consumer. Musk has a clear grasp on how to adapt his rhetorical strategies based on the rhetorical constraints of the situation he is presented with. Furthermore, because safety is such a sensitive topic, in the article “The Mission of Tesla” (aptly named as in and of itself, the is an appeal to pathos, convincing the reader that safety is the mission of Tesla), Musk explains that:


> Our primary concern is not for the safety of the vehicle, which can easily be replaced, but for the safety of our customers and the families they entrust to our cars. Based on the Model S track record so far, you have a zero percent chance of being hurt in an accident resulting in a battery fire, but what about other types of accidents? Despite multiple high-speed accidents, there have been no deaths or serious injuries in a Model S of any kind ever
> 
> (Musk, “The Mission of Tesla”).

in order to convince the reader that they have nothing to worry about in a Tesla car.


In situations that are not as solemn as those involving vehicle accidents, in order to connect with the reader, Musk often makes subtle jokes in writing. However, when he employs humor, he does it subtly instead of forced and still gets his main message across. For example, when talking about the safety of batteries in the Tesla, he says “I wouldn’t recommend them as a dessert topping, but the Tesla Motors Lithium-Ion cells are not classified as hazardous and are landfill safe.” In this quote, Musk clearly addresses the main point of the section of the article, but at the same time uses the humor as an interesting hook to grab the reader’s attention (Musk, “The Secret Tesla Motors Plan”). At times, Musk even uses mockery to achieve his point. In response to NJ Governor Christie’s decision to ban Tesla direct to customer sales in New Jersey, Musk writes “The rationale given for the regulation change that requires auto companies to sell through dealers is that it ensures “consumer protection”. If you believe this, Gov. Christie has a bridge closure he wants to sell you! Unless they are referring to the mafia version of “protection”, this is obviously untrue.” At this point, Musk is trying to convince the public that Chris Christie is in the wrong on the Tesla ban legislation. While disguising his ad hominem attack as humor, it is in reality a skillful attempt to attack the credibility of Chris Christie by reminding the readers of a well known scandal involving the subject of the attack. By linking Christie to a past situation in which he was in the wrong, Musk implants in the minds of his readers that Christie is probably in the wrong in this situation as well (Musk, “To the People of New Jersey”). Even though Ad Hominem attacks are debate fallacies, in the real world of rhetoric, they can be effective tools for guiding the audience’s thoughts.In this situation, Musk effectively used the attack to set up his audience to accept with more open minds (or closed against Christie, depending on your perspective) his reasoning on why Christie is in the wrong:


> Governor Christie had promised that this would be put to a vote of the elected state legislature, which is the appropriate way to change the law. When it became apparent to the auto dealer lobby that this approach would not succeed, they cut a backroom deal with the Governor to circumvent the legislative process and pass a regulation that is fundamentally contrary to the intent of the law
> 
> (Musk, “To the People of New Jersey”).

Musk appeals to the audience’s pathos, assuming that the audience values the law and people who keep their word, thus setting up his wording to present Christie decision’s to go against both of these values.

In the struggle over the right for Tesla to sell directly to the customer, circumventing the dealership, Tesla has received a lot of opposition. In defending the company’s model, on top of the ad hominem attack, Musk also uses several other claims to make his point. Along with citing the economical needs of the company to avoid the dealership model, he also uses the public opinion polls as an appeal to ethos to convince his audience. He writes:


> Consumers across the country have also voiced their opinion on the sales model they prefer. In North Carolina, a Triangle Business Journal poll found that 97 percent of people polled said Tesla should be allowed to sell cars directly. A poll by the Austin Business Journal showed that 86 percent of respondents were in favor of direct sales, and in a Los Angeles Times poll 99 percent of respondents came to the same conclusion…We have not seen a single poll that didn’t result in an overwhelming majority saying they preferred the direct model to the traditional dealer model. Democracy is supposed to reflect the will of the people
> 
> (Musk, “To the People of New Jersey”).

Through this, he attempts to gain more credibility by calling upon someone the public holds in high regard, themselves, the public.

Elon Musk, is a well-versed in the craft of rhetoric and can adapt and use it to the situation he is in order to achieve his purpose, convincing the public of the viability of electric cars. He uses several appeals to logos, ethos, and pathos in order to counterargue the attacks on Tesla’s purpose, specifically its environmental impacts, safety and business models. His public image is one that is very influential and in the coming years, his continued advocacy for the electric car will push more and more Americans into the light about the reality of our automobile future. Once the noise for electric cars increases, other companies will be compelled to move into electric cars, in the end achieving Musk’s true goal for Tesla, to convince to world of the viability of electric cars and move us towards a more sustainable transportation infrastructure for all mankind.

  Curious to see what Shakespeare would sound like set in modern slang, I translated line 1–64 of The Winter’s Tale Act IV Scene IV into this “new vernacular.”

**Florizel:** Yo here comes the squad, stay trill.> “We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world–its good facts, its bad facts, its beauties, and its ugliness; see the world as it is and be not afraid of it.

It is a conception quite unworthy of free men.”

> — Bertrand Russell

As an atheist myself, I could relate to this piece very much. I have engaged in many debates regarding religion and spirituality, and have and used similar arguments many times. I agreed with many of his arguments against the existence of a higher power and the church impeding on scientific progress. However, I do not concur with many of his arguments specifically attacking the merits of Jesus Christ himself. I personally believe that Jesus Christ was perhaps one of the greatest humans to walk the earth. I simply doubt that he was the son of God. Rather he was most likely one of the greatest orators, doctors, and people of his time. However, his abilities got exaggerated to the point where they became divine. I personally believe this is true for many divine figures in all sorts of religions such as Mohammed, Krishna, and Achilles. Regardless, with the rest of his arguments, I concur completely and have already begun formulating ways to reference his ideas in future debates and discussions.

Bertrand Russell first gave this essay as a lecture in 1927 to the National Secular Society. He begins his attack by defining what it is he is attacking. He specifically defines what consists of a Christian. He then systematically executes his contentions in order. He begins with refuting the common “proofs” of the existence of a god, such as the First Case Argument, the Natural Law Argument,and the Argument from Design. Of course at this point, he has already made his point about being an atheist. However, he then continues his case specifically against Christianity, while the first contention could have applied to all religions. He argues that Jesus Christ could not possibly be the wisest and greatest of men. Furthermore he finally attacks the church itself and specifically how it retarded scientific and social progress. Russell’s tone is very objective and matter-of-factly. He uses logic to derive his conclusions. At times, he uses humour to keep his audience intrigue. For example, at one point he logically came to the conclusion that either A, God does not exist, or B, God must report to the Devil as a superior. The church wouldn’t be quite happy about either scenario. Russell uses many sources in his work including the works of other intellectuals such as Voltaire and Socrates, and even textual references from the gospels themselves.

  In its time of rebirth, the world’s greatest empire needed a source of inspiration. The Romans and the rest of the world looked to Virgil, one of the greatest poets in human history, to provide this new hope. Virgil’s poems are a great work of art and are intriguing to both academia and entertainment. Virgil, the great Roman poet is considered to be the greatest of his time and wrote three major works that were the *Eclogues*, the *Georgics*and the epic *Aeneid*. These works were a source of inspiration and great craftsmanship in both storytelling and poetry. His writings were so admirable, that another epic poet, Dante, in his own epics, used Virgil as the guide for the main character (Hollander). The works of the Roman poet Virgil were deeply influenced by his life and environment which can be seen through the influence of his early life, his Roman pride, and his respect for the Greek poet Homer.

Firstly, one of the biggest influences on the Virgil’s works was the interesting life he led, and more specifically his early life. Virgil’s parents were an interesting pair; his father, whose name is unknown, was either a day laborer or a potter but his mother, Maggia Pollia’s family was part of the lower gentry, respectable but not particularly wealthy. It is commonly believed that the Maggia’s father Magius was the employer of Virgil’s father and took a liking to the worker. As a reward, he gave to him his daughter’s hand in marriage. Publius Virgilius Maro or Virgil was born on October 15th, 70 BCE in Andes, a countrified region near the town of Mantua, in Cisalpine Gaul (now Italy) and lived until 19 BCE. At the time of his birth, Virgil was not a true Roman citizen because Mantua did not receive citizenship rights until 49 BCE, twenty-one years into Virgil’s life. The young Virgil lived in an area where farmland was bountiful and peaceful. However, outside the walls of isolation that surrounded Cisalpine Gaul, turmoil was also bountiful. Civil War raged between the first triumvirate, which consisted of Julius Caesar, Gnaius Pompeius and Marcus Licinius Crassus (“Virgil” Poetryfoundation.org; Robert).

Virgil’s father had high expectations for his son and with the small wealth acquired from marrying Maggia Pollia, he was able to pay for a proper education for Virgil (Robert). Virgil went to both Rome and Cremona at the age of five where he studied many disciplines including medicine, forensics, philosophy and astronomy (“Virgil” Poetryfoundation.org). Virgil took an immediate liking to both forensics and philosophy. However, his education lacked the deeper philosophical content of Greek education, which Virgil envied, so Virgil pursued forensics. After finishing his primary and secondary educations, Virgil stayed in Rome to receive his higher education. Virgil pursued forensics, but was not very talented at the art of rhetoric. At this time, he met a mentor by the name Epidius. From him he learned Greek literature and Epicurean philosophy. Later in Virgil’s life, these disciplines will play a big role in influencing his works..

After completing his tertiary education, Virgil traveled back to the Andes around 44 BCE and began to live with his family (Robert). It was about this time that the civil war ended between the first triumvirates with Caesar being the victor. The empire looked for a brighter future but then, on the Ides of March (March 15) of 44 BCE, the empire turned once again to chaos; the Roman senate assassinated Caesar (Assassination of Julius Caesar). This event led to the creation of the second triumvirate, which consisted of Mark Antony, Octavian (later to be known as Augustus), and Lepidus to wage war on the conspirators that had murdered Caesar. The war drew to a close by 41 BCE with the triumvirs as the victors (Phillips and Axelrod). Although, Mark Antony won the war, he faced many losses and was not able to pay his soldiers their due wages. Many of these soldiers, angry at not receiving what they were promised, took out their anger by looting farmers in Northern Italy, where Virgil’s family lived. They abducted farmlands from their owners in revenge for not receiving the farmland they were promised. Virgil’s farm was on the brink of takeover when Roman commissioners Gallus, Varus and Pollio, friends of Virgil from his time in Rome, suggested that Virgil’s family should petition the new leader Octavian for help. This action saved the farm for a few years. The benevolent actions of these three men were forever immortalized in Virgil’s *Eclogues*, which Virgil started to write in this period of time.

It was 43 BCE and for the next six years, Virgil settled into his hometown and worked on his family’s farm. For these six years from 43–37 BCE, Virgil wrote his set of ten *Eclogues*, also known as Bucolics (Robert). These set of ten poems were deeply influenced by Virgil’s life so far. It was centered on a rural theme based on his surroundings at the time of the writing. The characters of nearly all the epilogues were shepherds and simple people, those of which he was acquainted with. He used the skills he learned from his mentors and borrowed heavily from the Greeks. They were modeled on the Idylls of Theocritus, used a Callimachean doctrine of poetic fineness, and imitated the pastoral style of Hesiod. Theocritus, Hesiod and Callimachus were three of the many great Greek poets that Virgil looked up to during his education and saw as role models and honored them by using their teachings in his own works (Putnam 9). The first *Eclogue*, showed Virgil’s thankfulness to the actions of Gallus, Varus, and Pollio, the Roman Commissioners that saved his family’s land (Robert). The first *Eclogue*concerns two friends Maliboeus and Tityrus in the time following Julius Caesar’s assassination. Both are about to loose their lands because of a political deal. Maliboeus gives in and is about to move to either Britain or Africa. Tityrus, however escapes the ordeal by going to Rome and begging for his land (Virgil, “Aeneid”). It is quite clear that this *Eclogue* was influenced by both the social times of Virgil’s personal experience of almost losing his land. Virgil tries to make his readers love Rome by showing how benevolent they are. This Roman kindness is also shown when Tityrus offers Maliboeus to stay with him:


> “Yet here, this night, you might repose with me,
> 
> On green leaves pillowed: apples ripe have I,
> 
> Soft chestnuts, and of curdled milk enow.
> 
> And, see, the farm-roof chimneys smoke afar,
> 
> And from the hills the shadows lengthening fall!”
> 
> (Virgil, “Eclogue 1” 109–113).

Virgil’s pride for his nation is clearly demonstrated in the lines,


> “The city, Meliboeus, they call Rome,
> 
> I, simpleton, deemed like this town of ours…
> 
> Comparing small with great; but this as far
> 
> Above all other cities rears her head
> 
> As cypress above pliant osier towers,”

while Tityrus praises Rome for saving his farm. While Tityrus is telling his friend Maliboeus about the wonders he saw in Rome, Virgil subtly puts a notion of the grandeur of Rome in the readers mind (Virgil, “Eclogue 1” 31–38). He also uses the Eclogue, written at a time when Virgil was living on the farm, to show the life of a Roman peasant, his life so far. This *Eclogue *shows an interesting point of merging between Rome’s two pre-Christian religions. It does not display only Saturn’s facile primitivism, the old way of the Roman people, a lifestyle based around pastoralism but also displays Jupiter’s idealism, a belief in the concept of social freedom (Putnam 23). This *Eclogue*, as seen in the lines,


> “Has civil discord brought our hapless folk! / For such as these, then, were our furrows sown,”along with *Eclogue* 9 warn that reality is not ideal and that the worst can happen
> 
> (Virgil, “Eclogue 1”).

After this 6-year period of peace, in 37 BCE, the former soldiers of Antony once again attacked and this time succeeded. Virgil and his father were forced to flee south. For some time, the father and son resided with Virgil’s old tutor Siro, then in a villa near Nola, and finally ended in Naples. It was here that Virgil resided for the next 8 years, from 37–29 BCE, and composed his four-book poem known as the *Georgics (*Robert). The *Georgics *were all related to farming and the natural world. They all glorified the hard lives of farmers and gave deep insight into humanity, using philosophical ideas he learned from fellows such as Hesiod and Lucretius. Virgil used bees to signify a perfect race for their abilities to be partially human yet divine, communally minded, instinctively aggressive, ignorant of love, eternal in some eyes, but still equally the prey of death. Also it is seen that as early as the writings of the third and fourth *Georgics*, Virgil already demonstrated great praise for Octavian, even comparing him to Jupiter. This was undoubtedly due to his experiences from his younger life during the earlier civil wars, when Octavian helped spare his family’s lands. The works of Virgil were heavily influenced by his early life in both his education and experiences.

Secondly, another one of the greatest influences on the works of Virgil was his pride for his nation. During Virgil’s life, after the third civil war, the Roman Empire saw the greatest period of expansion it has ever seen. This time was known as the Pax Romana. During this time, it was at its highest peak of economic, social, and political power. During this time, much advancement in religion was made. More temples were created and people found a renewed belief in these deities (“Augustan Rule”). This renewed faith allowed Virgil to incorporate a divine element in his epic, the *Aeneid.*Virgil saw the *Aeneid *as a chance to show off to the world how great Rome was. It was more important then than ever before. These ideas however were not Virgil’s alone. Octavian, who now styled himself as Augustus, was now the indisputable leader of the empire. He turned the empire from a republic to an empire but not everyone was happy with the new government. Augustus needed to prove himself to the world. He had high hopes and visions for Rome; he envisioned it as a sophisticated, urbanized empire. To do this, he first had to prove himself as a leader and bring the people together after the past century of war. Augustus realized that he needed a national epic, one that would people be proud to be Roman, and Augustus thought no one was more qualified than Virgil. The two went along quite well, because of their common insistence for perfection. This influenced his works because neither Virgil nor Augustus would take anything that wasn’t perfect, which forced Virgil to spend painstakingly long anounts of ime to edit single lines to make them flawless (Robert).

Finally, the third major influence on the works of Virgil is the works of the Greek poet Homer, author of the *Iliad *and the *Odyssey. *Virgil saw Homer as a role model but at the same time, he tried to outdo him. During Virgil’s education, while studying literature, he closely studied both of Homer’s works. Virgil’s respect for the poet can be seen through the *Aeneid’s *obvious imitation of both the *Iliad *and *Odyssey (*Adler 3). The *Aeneid *uses many of the same characters as Homer’s works and literally picks up where the *Iliad*ended (Robert). There are many similarities between the plot of the Homeric epics and the *Aeneid. *In the *Aeneid*, the climax is when Aeneas kills Turnus in revenge for Turnus killing his dear friend Pallas. This theme of revengeful climax is not new; Achilles killed Hector in revenge for the death of his friend Patroclus and Odysseus killed the suitors in revenge for them attempting to steal his kingdom and wife (findthedata.org). Despite Virgil’s respect, a sense of rivalry between the two epic poets is definitely seen. Virgil tries to outdo both of Homer’s great epics in one of his own. His epic contains the wandering hero of the *Odyssey *in the first six books with the warring hero of the *Iliad *in the last six. Using this context, when scholars study Virgil vs. Homer, they examine the differences between Homer’s duality and Virgil’s singularity (Adler 5). One of the events that many scholars use to compare Homer and Virgil are the underworld adventures of Odysseus and Aeneas. Carlos Parada, a researcher in Greek and Roman mythology created a map to provide a visual guide in comparing the journeys of the two heroes. For one, Aeneas’ journey shows Virgil’s respect for Homer by making his own character go on a similar journey as Homer’s character, Odysseus. Both heroes had guides to help them in their journey. Odysseus had Circe in the mortal world and Tiresias in the underworld. Aeneas had his own guides, Sybll of Cumae among the living and Anchises amongst the dead.

Virgil’s attempts to outdo Homer were seen in the obstacles that the heroes had to face on their respective journeys. Odysseus had to face only the Grove of Persephone and the Rock of Unburied Souls. When Aeneas had his chance to venture into the land of the undead, he had to face far more obstacles including the Elm of False Dreams, the Vale of Mourning and the Plain of Judgment. Another difference between the two journeys is that in the underworld, Odysseus was mentally challenged by having to face people from his life. Aeneas on the other hand had to physically fight his way past dead souls, strength being a characteristic valued by Romans over intellectual and mental abilities (Parada). Using these comparisons, it is possible to examine the respectful yet jealousy-filled relationship between these two epic poets, both masters of literature of their own eras.

When examining the *Aeneid*, what is often considered to be Virgil’s greatest works, we see the effects of all three influences. For one, Virgil’s early life is demonstrated through the influences of his education and the insistence for perfection drilled into him at an early age (Putnam 11). Since he died before the *Aeneid *was ever published, he wanted it to be burned because he did not have a chance to edit it (Robert). Virgil shows his love and pride in his nation when within the very first few lines, of the *Aeneid*, he jumps into praising Rome


> “The Latian realm, and built the destin’d town;
> 
> His banish’d gods restor’d to rites divine,
> 
> And settled sure succession in his line,
> 
> From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
> 
> And the long glories of majestic Rome,”
> 
> (Virgil, “Aeneid” 6–10).

Within these five lines, he claims Rome to be the destined town and claims all Romans to be noble because of their noble and royal bloodlines including those of both Troy and their Alban (Latinian) ancestors (Putnam 12). Virgil’s most clever way of exemplifying Rome is by using events in the story to compliment those in real life. He does this by making the Antagonist be Juno. Juno (Greeks) hurts Aeneas (Trojans) during the Trojan War, so now in the future, Aeneas (Romans) get revenge by conquering Juno (Greeks). This characterization exemplified and displayed Rome’s successful conquest of Greece. The same concept is also seen when Juno (Carthage) hurts Aeneas, so in revenge, Aeneas (Romans) hurt Juno (Carthage) by burning Carthage in the Punic Wars:


> “That times to come should see the Trojan race
> 
> Her Carthage ruin, and her tow’rs deface,”
> 
> (Virgil, “Aeneid” 29–30)

This was used to boast and show off Rome’s greatest military victory of the time, the victory of the Punic Wars.

The very first line of the Aeneid,

> “Arma virumque cano,”shows Virgil’s imitation and merging of the *Iliad *and *Odyssey (Virgil, “Aeneid” 1).

*Arma stands for the Achilles and *Iliad *while Virumque stands for Odysseus and the *Odyssey (*Adler 3). The merging of the *Iliad *and the *Odyssey* can also be seen in the lines,


> “Expell’d and exil’d, left the Trojan shore.
> 
> Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,
> 
> And in the doubtful war, before he won,”
> 
> (Virgil, “Aeneid” 3–5).

When Aeneas is expelled from the Trojan shore and faces long labors, Virgil pays a direct homage to the *Odyssey. *Then during the doubtful war, the reference to the *Iliad *is obvious. Virgil’s competition with Homer is also seen when Virgil, noticing that Homer invokes the muse, takes the task upon himself as seen in the first line of the epic,


> “Arms, and the man I sing…” (Virgil, “Aeneid” 1).

By claiming that he sings the epic, he attempts to show his superiority over Homer who had to invoke the muse to tell his epics. Another piece of evidence that supports the idea that Virgil tried to outdo Homer is that Homer speaks about mortal anger, Achilles’, in the *Iliad*, so Virgil tries to top that by focusing on divine anger, Juno’s (Adler 3–7). This is seen through the lines


> “What goddess was provok’d, and whence her hate, / For what offense the Queen of Heav’n began,” (Virgil, “Aeneid” 12)

The *Aeneid *is the best example of how all three of Virgil’s influences come together into his ultimate masterpiece.

In conclusion, Virgil, one of histories greatest poets had been influenced by his early life, his Roman pride, and his respect for the Greek poet Homer. This deduction is easily summed up by the quote, “Vergil, through the pastorals of his youth and the epic of his maturity, created verse which, while Greek in its inspiration, specifically reflects the sophistication of Augustan Rome,” (Robert). These three influences affected his work and made him the great poet he is. Virgil was just the source of inspiration that the world desperately needed at its time of discord and rebirth. He brought the people together and looked to the future by a looking to the past. His three works, the *Eclogues*, the *Georgics*, and the *Aeneid *continue to fascinate readers today, whether it be in academia or for entertainment. Virgil truly was the greatest Roman poet.

  At 12:17 p.m. on May 10, 1869, telegraph cables around the country transmitted a single click, a single click that represented the greatest engineering feat of the 19th Century. The final spike was driven into the ground at Promontory Summit, Utah signaling the completion of the world’s first transcontinental railroad. The work of over six years and 20,000 men was finally over, creating a 1,774 mile long railroad that would both unite a nation and tear it apart. The creation of the railroad that changed the American way of life was taken up by two entrepreneurial companies, Union Pacific and Central Pacific, that had taken big risks to get big returns. The story of the founding of Union Pacific was one stained with corruption, greed, and exploitation. The company that built half of one of the greatest railroad in history and changed the American free market forever would not have been possible without the courage and determination of a few daring men and their clever yet unethical actions.

The story of the railroad begins not in 1863, but rather in 1848 with the discovery of gold in Western California. The discovery led to a mass migration of Americans who left the eastern United States and began the long and treacherous trek west to the “land of gold” hoping to strike it rich. There were only three paths available to the prospective gold miners. They could choose to travel by station coach across the wide American prairie and the treacherous western mountain ranges, a journey that often took over six months. They could also choose the long sea voyage, braving the rough waters around the southern tip of South America. The third choice was the shorter but equally dangerous route of crossing Panama by land, a region filled with disease and violence. Despite the difficulties in traveling, tens of thousands of gold-lusting men migrated to “the land of gold.” Many new miner settlements, populated by the hundred-thousands of Americans who had settled California by the end of 1849, including San Francisco and Sacramento, had sprung up and become bustling towns on the west coast. Despite their exponential expansion rate, the largest obstacle in allowing these towns to match the grandeur of the large bustling cities of the eastern United States was their seclusion from the rest of the country. It could take months for raw materials, manufactured goods, and people to travel between California and the rest of the United States.

The people of the United States realized that if they were to utilize the vast natural resources of the West and protect these new settlements on the frontier, they would have to connect the East and the West. They looked to the emerging railroad industry, which had already laid over 15,000 miles of track connecting much of the Eastern United States, allowing Americans on the east coast to travel quickly and safely from city to city.  
In 1853, Congress authorized government-sponsored explorations called the Pacific Railroad Surveys to find possible routes to the Pacific Ocean. Under the supervision of Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, five potential routes were mapped and presented to Congress in twelve volumes. The northernmost route followed the 47th latitude from St. Paul, Minnesota to Seattle in the Washington Territory. The central route ran along the Platte River from Omaha, Nebraska to San Francisco, California. The route known as the Buffalo Trail ran through the New Mexico and Arizona territories to Southern California. Due to political tensions in Congress, no route was settled upon. Davis, a Mississippian, and the southern states wanted a southern route while the northern states backed a northern route. This standstill did not stop a few small bands of private surveyors from setting out west, beyond the Mississippi, to try to find their own path through the country that could serve as the path for the railroad.

One such surveyor was Grenville Dodge. Dodge was born on April 12, 1831 in Massachusetts. He was a railroad enthusiast, getting his first job at age 14 as a surveyor for Frederick Lander, another able surveyor. Impressed by Dodge’s ability and skill, Lander suggested Dodge attend Norwich University in Vermont to become an engineer. In 1848, when Dodge entered the University, he found it “filled with enthusiasm for expansion of railroads from the Atlantic to the Pacific.” Two months after completing his degree, he went to Illinois where he got a job at the Illinois Central railroad company. Dodge soon quit because he was much more interested in the Rock Island railroad company’s westward expansion than the Illinois Central’s southward expansion. In 1852, Dodge worked closely with Peter A. Dey of the Rock Island company to construct the Mississippi-Missouri railroad. Dey, one of the best railroad engineers in the country was very satisfied with Dodge. He once said: “Very soon I discovered that there was a good deal in him. I discovered a wonderful energy. If I told him to do anything he did [it] under any circumstances. That feature was particularly marked.” Dey, recognizing Dodge’s leadership, gave him his own stretch of land west of Iowa City, which he was responsible for surveying.

In 1853, Dodge led a party of fourteen men from Iowa City, hoping to reach the Missouri River before winter settled in. Dodge loved the wilderness he was exploring; he once wrote to his father: “Oh, that you could come out and overtake me on the prairies of Iowa, look at the country and see how we live. We shall make an examination of the great Platte as far into Nebraska as we think fit.” The open country of Iowa amazed the young engineer from New England. When Dodge arrived at Council Bluffs, it had a population of less than 2,500, but at first glance, Dodge thought to himself that this was the perfect site for the eastern terminus of the transcontinental railroad. After crossing the Missouri River on a flat boat, Dodge continued his expedition another 25 miles west of Omaha, a town with a population of 500, until he found the Elkhorn River at which point he turned back to Illinois.  
In July 1855, Dodge met with his old mentor, Frederick Lander, who had just completed a survey of the Washington Territory. He confirmed Dodge’s belief that a railroad along the 42nd parallel (making Omaha its eastern terminus) was the most logical path for the transcontinental railroad. After their meeting, Lander departed for Washington to oppose Jefferson Davis’s plan to build a southern railroad. Lander argued that while a southern railroad would be shorter, a central route would be cheaper and easier to defend in times of war. It would also be able to unite conflicting public and private interests. It would run on flat ground near water by following the valley of the Platte River.

Dodge was funded by railroad enthusiasts Henry Farnam and Dr. Thomas C. Durant, who had interests in the Rock Island company, to survey the route Lander had suggested. In 1856, he made a survey up the Platte Valley and beyond the Rocky Mountains and reported to his financiers. Durant then set out west to locate investors willing to invest in the railroad, but investors were wary because of the Panic of 1857, one of the worst financial recessions in American history. In 1858, Durant invited Dodge to New York City to attend a meeting to propose to the board of directors of the Rock Island company their idea for the railroad. Dodge reports that by the time the meeting had closed, the only three people left in the room were Durant, Farnam, and him. Everyone had left calling the proposal impossible and a waste of their time. The three men left were still strong in hopes and were determined. Durant and Farnam decided to stay in New York to continue scouting investors while Dodge left for Council Bluffs to begin making a grade, which is the process for creating the path that a railroad follows.

On August 13, 1859, an Illinois politician, Abraham Lincoln, made a speech in Council Bluffs. It gathered quite a large crowd due to Lincoln’s popularity in the previous year’s Lincoln-Douglas debates. After the speech, W.H.M. Pusey, a close friend of Lincoln’s, introduced Dodge to Lincoln as knowing more about railroads than any “two men in the country.” This caught Lincoln’s attention and he sat down with Dodge to ask him questions about the transcontinental railroad, a subject he was very interested in as he hoped to use it as a campaign platform in the next year’s presidential elections. Dodge told Lincoln about his plan for a path along the Platte Valley. Lincoln was immediately interested in what Dodge told him. The next year, Lincoln was nominated to be the Republican nominee for President, a great boon to the entire railroad industry. Lincoln, however, had graver problems on his mind. Just a few weeks after his inauguration, on April 12, 1861, the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter and the Civil War had started. Dodge had to put the railroad aside and join the army. To him, holding the country together north and south was more important than linking it east and west. The railroad, however, never left his mind nor Lincoln’s.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, another railroad revolution was brewing. The Californians were even more anxious for a railroad than their fellow Americans on the East Coast. For the Californians, life was difficult because it was very difficult to transport people, equipment, and basic supplies from the rest of the country. Four brave entrepreneurs took up the task meant for giants: Leland Stanford, Collis P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker, often collectively known as the Big Four. They created their own company called California Pacific and had big dreams to make fortunes making the transcontinental railroad. They recruited the talented Theodore Judah as their chief engineer. They would become the Union Pacific’s greatest rival in the race to complete the railroad.  
Back on the East Coast, the Civil War was still raging and in 1862, the Pacific Railroad Act authorized the creation of the Union Pacific company, the third company to get a federal charter after the first and second Banks of the United States. The 163 men appointed in the act served as the board of commissioners and had their first meeting in Chicago to work out a provisional organization for the company. Among this board were prominent railroad men, bankers, and politicians including five commissioners chosen by the president. Due to their disbelief in the feasibility of such a project, when the meeting opened on September 2, 1862, only sixty-seven of the directors came. Even among those who did show up, the majority had serious doubts about the possibility of building such a railroad. At the meeting, the attending commissioners selected Major General Samuel R. Curtis to be the temporary chairman, Chicago Mayor William B. Ogden to be president, and editor of the American Railroad Journal, Henry V. Poor, to be the secretary. The commissioners’ biggest problem was the first-mortgage nature of the government bonds which made it nearly impossible for the company to sell its own private bonds. The appointed directors arranged to open stock-subscription books in thirty-four different cities and to advertise in numerous newspapers. Despite their efforts, in the first four months of the sales, only 45 shares were sold to eleven men.

The biggest buyer was Brigham Young, the leader of the Mormons. Young thought that a transcontinental railroad would be necessary for his people, as it would connect Salt Lake City to the rest of the country. Due to this personal interest, Young bought five shares and was the only shareholder to pay in full. Durant, the Wall Street speculator who apparently put up the money for some of the other purchasers, bought twenty shares at ten percent down for himself and made the rounds of his friends, looking for them to subscribe. George Francis Train, an erratic promoter who had partnered with Durant to earn a fortune by smuggling contraband cotton from the Confederacy, took twenty Meanwhile, Dodge shares.

was still fighting in the Civil War and had received the rank of colonel in 1861. During the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwestern Arkansas, Dodge was badly injured, and during his recovery in a St. Louis hospital, men from the Union Pacific company urged him to quit the army and join the company. Dodge refused however, saying, “I have enlisted for the period of the war.” Over the next few months, Dodge received several offers trying to get him to quit the army and join the company. Dodge refused every time. At one point, despite his wife’s pleas, he turned down an offer from the Union Pacific to be the Chief Engineer and earn a salary of $5,000 a year. He wrote to his wife, “My heart is in the war; every day tells me that I am right, and you will see it in the future.” Even in the war, railroading never left his heart. Dodge was put to work designing railroads to move Union troops and supplies in the South. Dodge’s skill with railroading impressed his seniors. Ulysses S. Grant wrote of Dodge in his memoir:

Besides being a most capable soldier, he was an experienced railroad builder. He had no tools to work with except those of the pioneer — axes, picks and spades…General Dodge had the work finished in forty days after receiving his order.

Part of the reason that Dodge was so emotionally invested in the war was because he believed in what he was fighting for and supported the freedom of the slaves. It was his belief that one of the easiest ways to defeat the South was to arm the slaves so that they might fight against their masters. Dodge once said, “There is nothing that so weakens the south as to take its negroes.” Not all of his fellow officers felt the same way and did not want African Americans bearing arms for the Union. In the spring of 1863, General Grant dispatched Dodge to Washington to report to President Lincoln. Dodge confessed, “I was somewhat alarmed, thinking possibly I was to be called to account [for promoting the arming of slaves].”

He was surprised when he got to Washington and Lincoln wanted to talk about railroads, despite the fact that Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia were preparing to march into Pennsylvania. The President had been charged by the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 to fix the eastern terminus of the railroad. He recalled his previous discussions with Dodge in 1859 and wished to consult with him before making his final decision. Lincoln showed Dodge letters from towns all across the Missouri River filled with pleas to start the railroad in their town. Dodge wrote in his autobiography: “I found Mr. Lincoln well posted in all the controlling reasons covering such a selection and we went into the matter at length and discussed the arguments presented by the different competing localities.” Once again, Dodge reiterated his belief that the Platte Valley route was the obvious choice from both an engineering and commercial point of view. In a somewhat blunt manner, Dodge also told Lincoln that the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 has too many deficiencies in it, which he enumerated. One of the deficiencies that Dodge pointed out was the difficulty to raise capital to build the railroad. Lincoln agreed and said he would do what he could on the matter. Dodge and Lincoln did not necessarily see eye to eye on every issue however. Dodge said that it would very difficult for the private sector to build the railroad and that government should take up the task. Lincoln, on the other hand, said that while the government would provide support and aid, it “had all it could possibly handle in the conflict now going on.”

Elated by the president’s reaction, Dodge departed for New York where he met with Durant and told him of the discussion with Lincoln. Dodge and Durant had kept in touch during the period of the war; it was Dodge who provided Durant with information for the contraband cotton scandal. According to Dodge, Durant “took new courage” at the news of Lincoln’s response. Durant once again offered him a job and once again Dodge refused, saying:  
Nothing but the utter defeat of the rebel armies will ever bring peace…I have buried some of my best friends in the South, and I intend to remain there until we can visit their graves under the peaceful protection of that flag that every loyal citizens loves to honor and every fights to save.”

This patriotic speech spoke volumes about Dodge’s patriotism and dedication.  
By September 1863, two thousand shares were subscribed at $1,000 dollars each — the minimum ten percent that had to be put down for a $10,000 share. With the down payments, there was a total of $2 million to build the railroad that would cost anywhere from $100 million to $200 million or more. Most American Capitalists found the investment too risky and were unsure of whether such a railroad could be built. Also, because of the war, there were far more, less risky, short term investments to be made.

With the 10 percent in hand, the Union Pacific called for a meeting for the stockholders. During the meeting, on October 29, 1863, the original commissioners were discharged and a formal board of directors was elected. The next day, General John A. Dix, the dignified former president of the Mississippi and Missouri railroad company, was elected president of Union Pacific. This title was just honorary, however, as the true leader of the corporation was Durant, who was made vice-president.

Durant had the reports of the earlier surveys by Dey and his then assistant, Dodge. Two months earlier, Durant had sent Dey on another expedition paid for entirely from his own pocket. Durant contacted Dey by telegraph sending him the message: “Want preliminary surveys at once to make location of starting point. Delay is ruinous. Everything depends on you.” On November 17, Durant got Lincoln to sign an executive order defining the eastern terminus as “so much of the western boundary of the State of Iowa as lies between the north and south boundaries of…the city of Omaha.”  
Durant was eager to start working as Central Pacific had already had their opening ceremony 11 months earlier and had already begun building. Durant decided that Union Pacific must have a ceremony of its own in Omaha, even if only to get publicity. He ordered Dey to rush preparations and be ready by December 1. Dey did so and the ceremony was very grand indeed.

The citizens of Omaha flocked to the Ferry to where the ceremony was taking place. The governor of the Nebraska territory was given the honor of breaking the first shovel of dirt. Train gave an eloquent speech which inspired all that heard the excellent oratory. He started off with the line, “America possesses the biggest head and the finest quantity of brain in the phrenology of nations.” He went on to read congratulations from Lincoln and other dignitaries such as Secretary of State William Seward who wrote: “When this shall have been done disunion will be rendered forever after impossible. There will be no fulcrum for the lever of treason to rest upon.” The groundbreaking had brought speculators flocking to Omaha. Train himself bought 500 acres, some costing as much as $175 per acre. Dodge’s brother Nathan wrote to him exaggerating that, “every man, woman and child who owned enough ground to bury themselves upon was a millionaire, prospectively.” After the ceremony, Train wired Durant the message, “Five o’clock the child is born.” Durant was not entirely impressed for he had other plans in mind.

Durant was in the business to make money, not to build a railroad. During the ceremony, Durant was busy in the towns of Florence, which was just north of Omaha, and Bellevue, which was just south of Omaha. Durant had bought land both north and south of Omaha and planned to play the three cities against each other. In January of 1864, Durant ordered Dey to survey another from the town of De Soto, more than twenty miles North of Omaha. Instead of planning to begin building the line, Durant was just bombarding Dey with more possibilities. Dey was furious. He wrote to Dodge saying, “If the geography was a little larger, I think he [Durant] would order a survey round by the moon and a few of the fixed stars, to see if he could not get some depot grounds.” Enraged, Dodge wrote to Durant: “Let me advise you to drop the De Soto idea. It is one of the worst. Logic, Nature and President Lincoln dictated that the route run from Omaha to the Platte River and then west along the Platte Valley.” Still Durant persisted in his schemes. He was negotiated with businessmen of Omaha, Florence, Bellevue, and De Soto all at the same time, demanding that they give the railroad land for depots, rail, water storage, and more.

On January 1, 1864, President Dix signed a document formally appointing Dey as the chief engineer of the railroad and Colonel Silas Seymour as the consulting engineer. Seymour was a lazy and eccentric man who was given the nickname “interfering engineer.” He was chosen for the job, however, because his brother was governor of New York and the likely democratic candidate for President. Durant believed that it would be wise to have friends in both parties. Dey, eager to begin his surveys, sent two fine engineers, Samuel B Reed and James A. Evans, to run a line from the Black Hills to Salt Lake. They needed to start immediately if they were to finish by the autumn of 1884. Durant, however, refused to approve their expenditures. On April 4, 1864, Dey wrote to Dodge:

Durant is vacillating and changeable and to my mind utterly unfit to head such an enterprise…It is like dancing with a whirlwind to have anything to do with him. Today matters run smoothly and tomorrow they don’t…I could build the work for less money and more rapidly than can be done the way they propose to do it.

The majority of conservative capitalists refused to risk their fortunes and reputations on the railroad. They regarded its stocks and bonds as a reckless gamble for high stakes at long odds. George Francis Train realized the railroad would require an enormous amount of capital and it would be years before the railroad would return any dividends at all. They would have to find a way to raise money and provide short-term profits. Train decided that he would create a construction company that could make money through government loans and sales of land grants and stocks and bonds. A separate construction company would also limit the liability of the investors to the stock that they had. Most importantly, as stockholders in both the construction company and the railroad company, the investors could make a contract with themselves. Train thought it was a genius plan and once said, “An idea occurred to me that cleared the sky.” He mentioned his idea to Durant who gave him $50,000 to put it into action.  
In March 1864, Train and Durant bought a failing, obscure Pennsylvania corporation called Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency that had been chartered five years earlier to do nearly anything it wanted. The company was not even organized until May 1863, and even then, it had no business until Durant and Train were made the directors. In May, the board of directors was expanded to bring in more men from Union Pacific. Train renamed the company Crédit Mobilier and made it a construction company. They were able to sell lots of stock in the company. Ben Holladay, the “Stagecoach King”, and founder of the Holladay stagecoach line, bought $100,000 as did many others. Train himself bought $150,000 and Durant bought more than double that. Train later claimed that it was “the first so-called ‘trust’ organized in this country.”

Crédit Mobilier made a fortune nearly instantaneously. The process worked by the Union Pacific awarding construction contracts to dummy individuals who in turn would then assign them to Crédit Mobilier. Union Pacific would then pay Crédit Mobilier by check, with which Crédit Mobilier would buy Union Pacific stocks and bonds at par. It would then sell them in the open market for whatever it could fetch. The construction contracts made huge profits for Crédit Mobilier, which was owned by the principal stockholders of Union Pacific. Simply put, it did not matter if the railroad ever got up and running because Crédit Mobilier would make a fortune just from building it. Historian Thomas Cochran says:  
The procedure…often resulted badly for the original small investors who had bought the railroad bonds at or near par. But for the insiders, it meant excessive profits. In addition, it necessarily tended to vest control of the railroad in the hands of the chief stockholders of the construction company.

In short, Crédit Mobilier became the greatest American financial scandal of the 19th century.  
Almost everyone in Congress knew that the 1862 act would have to be modified. In May 1864, a new bill was presented to congress. Despite overwhelming support, a few congressmen were against the bill. Representative E.B. Washburne of Illinois called the revised bill “the most monstrous and flabbergasted attempt to overreach the government and the people that could be found in all the legislative annals of the country.” He argued that “ the Wall Street stock jobbers are using this great engine for their own private means.” Washburne was right about his last accusation. Both Durant of Union Pacific and Huntington of Central Pacific were in Washington handing out money and stocks to make sure the bill was passed. Joseph P. Stewart, a lobbyist hired by Durant, distributed $250,000 in Union Pacific bonds including $20,000 given to Charles T. Sherman, the older brother of General William Sherman, for “professional services” and $20,000 given to Clark Bell for drawing up the bill. Despite Washburne’s protests, the bill was passed by both houses, and on July 2nd, it was signed by President Lincoln, becoming the Pacific Railroad Act of 1864. The act allowed the directors of Union Pacific and Central Pacific to issue their own first-mortgage bonds in an equal amount to the government bonds, thus making the government bonds second mortgage. The government bonds would be handed over by Washington upon the completion of 20 miles of track instead of the original 40. Also, in Mountainous regions, the companies could now collect two-thirds of their subsidy on a 20 mile section once the track was graded. Also the companies were granted rights to coal, iron, and other minerals on their land grants, which were doubled to provide ten alternate sections on each side of every mile. This gave the companies nearly 12,800 acres per mile of track. Also, to attract investors, the par value of Union Pacific stock was reduced from $1,000 to $100 and the limit on the amount held by any one person was removed. The act also allowed Central Pacific to build up to 150 miles east of the Californian border while Union Pacific could build no further than 300 miles west of Salt Lake City. No exact meeting point was yet designated, however.  
Meanwhile, Dodge was serving under General William Sherman’s Sixteenth Army Corps. Just before Sherman’s capture of Atlanta on September 1, 1864, Dodge was shot in the head. He spent nearly the entire month in the hospital but was motivated to return to the army as soon as he recovered. In the hospital, however, he got a letter from Durant asking him to travel to New York as soon as possible to meet with the Union Pacific officials. So, in October, Dodge traveled to New York. When he got there, Durant once again offered to make him chief engineer of the Union Pacific and Dodge once again declined. He then departed on a boat down to Grant’s headquarters in City Point, Virginia. Grant offered him command of one of his divisions but Dodge said that he would prefer to serve in the West. Although Grant felt that Dodge was not up for serving with Sherman again, he humored him and suggested that he call on President Lincoln.

Lincoln sent Dodge much farther west than he had expected. Dodge was sent to St. Louis, where he became commander for the Department of the Missouri. Lincoln wanted him there because of the problems confronting the government from the Indian situation of the Great Plains and to protect the Union Pacific when it began building. Dodge’s reputation in the war could not have been better, especially for his skill in working with the railroads. The friendships he had earned were strong. Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan trusted him and he trusted them. Union General O.O. Howard observed that “Dodge could talk to Sherman as no other officer dared to do.”

By that December, Dey had graded and spent $100,000 on twenty-three miles of track west of Omaha. Dey nearly exploded with anger when Seymour suggested that they abandon the path. Seymour and Durant both favored a route up Mud Creek, an oxbow shaped detour that would add an extra nine miles. The detour would bring in an extra $144,000 in government and company bonds, 115,200 acres of federal land grants, and more profits for Crédit Mobilier. Tensions between Dey and Durant only heightened when Durant’s front man, Iowa politician Herbert Hoxie, offered a contract that said he would build the first 247 miles for $50,000 to $60,000 per mile. Dey’s plan, however, stated that the cost was only $30,000 dollars per mile. The contract was signed and immediately turned over to Crédit Mobilier. Durant ordered Dey to resubmit his proposal and make it $60,000 per mile. Dey thought about it for over many weeks and finally wrote to Durant that he believed that amount “would so cripple the road that it would be impossible to ever build [it].” After giving it much thought, on December 7, Dey wrote to Union Pacific President Dix to tender his resignation. He wrote: “My reasons are, simply, that I do not approve of the contract made with Mr. Hoxie…and I do not care to have my name so connected with the railroad that I shall appear to endorse this contract.” He wanted no part in the corrupt dealings and reluctantly “resigned the best position in [his] profession this country had ever offered to any man.” By the time Dey had left Union Pacific, the company had only graded just over 20 miles and had not laid a single tie, let alone any rails.  
On December 6, 1864, the newly re-elected President Lincoln delivered his Annual Message to Congress. The war was the main topic but he gave a paragraph to the transcontinental railroad, calling it “this great enterprise”. He said:  
[It] has been entered upon a vigor that gives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento, eastward, to the great bend of the Truckee River, in Nevada.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, Central Pacific was also hard at work. Although the Railroad Bill of 1864 had promised immense benefits, the company could not begin receiving its benefits until they completed 50 miles of track. By the end of 1864, the company was nearly broke and Central Pacific stock was selling at 19 cents on the dollar. Crocker, one of the Big Four, admitted that he was suffering from insomnia and “would be willing to give up everything I have in the world , in order to cancel my debts.” The company was already finished with 36 miles of track, only 14 miles away from being able to tap into the reservoir of government bonds that would have been able to fund the company and pay off its debts. However, their greatest challenge was yet come; every mile that Central Pacific built brought them closer to the towering Sierra Nevadas.  
On January 15, 1865, Dodge received a telegram from Lincoln ordering him to pay special attention to Missouri, a state badly divided between the North and the South. Dodge, however, felt that his duty was to curb the Indians, who would burn, loot, rape, and rob American settlements. On January 7, 1865, Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians rode into Julesburg, Colorado; they killed 15 soldiers along with many civilians and they burned down all of the buildings. Soon after this event, Dodge moved his headquarters from St. Louis to Fort Leavenworth on the Missouri River in Kansas. Dodge sent out an order to all district commanders on the Great Plains; he said:  
Place every mounted man in your command on the South Platte route; repair telegraph lines, attack all bodies of hostile Indians large or small; stay with them and pound them until they move north of the Platte or south of the Arkansas [River]. I am coming with two regiments of cavalry to the Platte line and will open and protect it.

Dodge was carrying out his special injunction given to him by Grant, “to remove all trespassers [Indians] on land of the Union Pacific Railroad.” He toured the entire region and made sure every single soldier was in the saddle hunting down Indians. The general manager of the Overland Telegraph notified Washington that communication had been restored from the Mi¬ssissippi to California. Grant wired him a query, “Where is Dodge?” The General Manager replied, “Nobody knows where he is but everybody knows where he has been.” Later that year, General Sherman had been made the commanding officer of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Sherman wrote in his Memoirs  
My thoughts and feelings at once reverted to the construction of the great Pacific Railway, which was then in progress.I put myself in communication with the parties engaged in the work, visiting them in person, and assured them that I would afford them all possible assistance and encouragement.”

Dodge’s campaigning was critical to the success of the Union Pacific. Durant and his fellow directors, however, were desperate for a new Chief Engineer upon the departure of Dey. They offered Dodge a salary of $10,000 a year and stock in Crédit Mobilier if he resigned from the army and joined the company. In his reply, Dodge pointed out that a railroad could not be built across the Plains until the Indians were subdued. General Sherman, understanding this connection, backed Dodge and communicated his belief to the Union Pacific directors. Not a single one of the directors dared to challenge William T. Sherman, They telegraphed Dodge that the position of chief engineer would be held open for him until he finished his Indian Campaign.  
On January 20, 1865, Lincoln called Congressman Oakes Ames. Lincoln told him:  
Ames, you take hold of this. If the subsidies provided are not enough to build the road, ask double, and you shall have it. The road must be built, and you are the man to do it. Take hold of it yourself. By building the Union Pacific, you will become the remembered man of your generation.

Ames was glad to have Lincoln appeal to him and began to put his money and political clout into the enterprise. Together with his brother Oliver, he bought $1 million of Crédit Mobilier stock and loaned Union Pacific $600,000.  
Meanwhile, the fight over the oxbow route had cost Union Pacific almost $500,000 and even more in good will. The Chicago Tribune called the oxbow and “outrage” perpetrated by “a set of unprincipled swindlers” intent on “building the road at the largest possible expense to the Government and the least possible expense to themselves.” To add to the problems even more, Engineer Samuel Reed reported that his surveys were:  
Extremely difficult and dangerous [because of] hostility of the Indians everywhere. Until they are exterminated, or so far reduced in numbers as to make their power contemptible, no safety will be found in that vast district extending from Fort Kearney to the mountains, and beyond.

Furthermore, Durant faced a logistical nightmare. Getting building materials to Omaha required shipping them up the Missouri River from St. Joseph, Missouri, a path that involved navigating up 175 miles of winding river that was only navigable by steamboat for three or four months a year. The only wood that was available in the area was cottonwood, which was so wet that it would only last for two or three years. Along with this, laborers were so hard to get that Dodge even offered captive Indians for the grading.  
In April 1865, as the Civil War came to an end, President Lincoln was shot and killed. While the railroad companies had just lost their most powerful friend, for the Union Pacific, it meant that thousands of young men from both the Union and Confederate armies were now unemployed. Also for both Central Pacific and Union Pacific, it meant that huge quantities of money were going to be suddenly released. With almost explosive force, the industrial, financial, and transportation systems of the North were let loose. On July 22, 1865 Harper’s Weekly ran an article called “Railroads in Peace-Time” that summed up the state of the railroad industry and predicted what was to be expected in the future. “From 1859 to 1864 the business of the roads had more than doubled,” it opened. It went on to state that in June of 1865:  
Traffic returns show an average increase over last year of 30 to 40 percent — far in excess of those of the most active period of the war. This is an astounding fact, one for which not one among the best-informed railroad men or Wall Street financiers was prepared.

The articles goes on to state, “Our roads, at best, are only half built. The only cost, on the average, $40,000 a mile…”  
Meanwhile, Dodge was returning from his Powder River campaign when he stumbled upon Lodgepole Creek in the Black Hills. Curious, he took 6 other men with him to explore up the creek, which eventually discharged itself into the South Platee River. When he got to the summit of the Cheyenne Pass, he headed south along the crest of the mountains to get a good view. What he saw amazed him. There were open meadows covered with grass and flowers with mountains on either side. Dodge wrote, “We followed this ridge out until I discovered it led down to the plains without a break…I believe we found the crossing of the Black Hills.” Soon afterwards, in April 1866, after completing his campaign, Dodge quit the army and took up his position as the chief engineer of the railroad.  
Finally, after all of its problems in getting started, the Union Pacific railroad company was ready to embark on its journey to create 1,087 miles of track that would change the country. It finally had the capital, the leadership, and the right engineer to take on the task meant for giants. The company’s problems were in no way over for they would face many hardships in the years to come. However, they had finally got all the elements needed to complete the task and the work could finally truly begin. Union Pacific and its Western mate Central Pacific were about to become the biggest businesses in America. The two companies were about to set forth the first step in ushering in the new era of reconstruction that would be needed to mend the wounds of a fragile, reunited country.

  There are 1.3 million identified animals species that occupy the Earth right now but none have changed the face of the planet more than the human being. The night sky can now be seen from space. One hundred square miles of land can be obliterated at the press of a button. We have built bridges connecting land masses separated by large bodies of water. Humans were blessed with this great power of intelligence which would allow us to rule the world. However, as Uncle Ben once said to Spiderman, “With Great Power comes great responsibility.” But what is this great responsibility that humans must fulfil? Who do we owe this responsibility to? If anything, we owe it to ourselves.

The philosopher Ayn Rand says in her philosophy known as Objectivism that an individual’s responsibility is to himself and himself only. This is absolutely true. The sole responsibility that humans or any organism has is to keep oneself content. Part of keeping oneself content is keeping oneself alive. This is the background for the sole purpose of almost every species on Earth. Survive. Most animals’ lives are centered around keeping oneself alive. Eat. Don’t get eaten. Eat. Don’t get eaten. Eat. Don’t get eaten. A constant cycle that an organism will go through its entire life only to keep itself alive, to keep itself alive. This the life of every species but one. Humans have advanced so much that the simply surviving does not satisfy us. The job of surviving is a far simpler task than it is for most species, and we can thank our ancestors for that. After not having to fight to survive for the majority of our existence as a species has made us bored of simply surviving and it does make satisfy us as simply as it does other creatures. Nevertheless, we still must perform our responsibility to keep ourselves content. So new ways have been found to keep oneself content. Whether it be a sport or a television, a tasty food or a lavish home, man has created and found new ways to satisfy himself. Sadly, the concept of scarcity butts in. There are limited resources to satisfy our unlimited desires. Here, the competition must begin, and here we see humans’ true natures show, their desire to benefit themselves, even if it is at the expense of others.

Humans’ one true responsibility is to keep themselves happy. Everything else is an offshoot of this one responsibility. For example, the responsibility to not kill another person is not a result of owing the other person a responsibility, rather owing oneself the responsibility of keeping yourself happy by not having to sit in a jail cell for years at end. One might say that this view of humans is inhumane and that it takes away what makes us different than the rest of the Animal Kingdom. However they are sadly mistaken. What differentiates us is our thumbs and our intelligence, not the nature of our being. We are powerful animals, but animals never the less. Our only responsibility is to ourselves. Why did we so radically change the face of the planet? It was for no reason than the fact that it benefited us. Whether it made our lives easier, made us money, or made us famous, we did it to make ourselves a little bit happier, we did it for ourselves

It is amazing that we believe that we are so heavily isolated and disconnected from the human trafficking industry. We think that this dirty business only goes in third-world countries. If we were told that there was human trafficking going on this second within the borders of the US, we’d respond with, “No way! Slavery’s been illegal since the civil war!” It is even more surprising when we find that the US is one of the top two destinations for human trafficking every year. Despite the horror in this revelation, it just might a hidden blessing. If the US government notices this atrocity going on inside its own country, it and other powerful governments around the world will be inclined to help internationally in stopping this horrible business.

  If I had to choose one word to describe the entire book, it would be the word “loss.” The entire book is a story of loss: the loss of his family, the loss of his God, and the loss of humanity. The novel explored the concept of loss and how it seemed to mean less and less to Eliezer as the bitter reality of the Holocaust wore at him. The most striking example of this is in how he essentially ended up renouncing his religion as a result of the hardships he had to endure. Weisel tried to keep his faith to the best of his ability until he was forced to face the horrors of the Holocaust. But as the hardships grew and more died, Weisel was forced to wonder “where his God was,” even at points feeling enraged that his God would allow this to happen. In a cruel, twisted way, the Nazis ended up killing the Jew; Wiesel himself was not dead, but the believer within was. What kind of God would let this happen to his own followers? Where was the God that brought Moses and his people to safety? Non-existent. One of the best quotes that demonstrates this is his description of the first night in the camp “which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust.”

The Nazi’s through their own lack of humanity, brought upon the Jewish people their own loss of humanity. By the end, Weisel who spent the entire book caring for his father, feels almost a sense of relief that his father was gone. When a fellow prisoner says to him about his father, “you are only hurting yourself. In fact you should be getting his rations,” Weisel believes it.

On this note, one of the most striking things that hit me about the book was that the notion that a pre-determined hatred of a people by all of Europe is what fueled the immorality and total disregard for humanity. However, throughout his memoir, Weisel makes an effort to shine the humanity though the inhumanity of the world. Some of the people whom Wiesel encountered such as many of the Kapos and others like German Jews only pretended to share Hitler’s view to save the lives of their own. The dissolvement of many of the morals held by the Jews themselves can be attributed to one cause, the most primitive and animalistic cause that everyone has, to survive, and if that means the death of others, than so be it. This is the cause of boys killing their fathers, not hatred but rather necessity. This is by far my most memorable scene of the entire book, when the father manages to get a piece of bread, but the son, instead of sharing with his father, kills him to get at the bread, only to be killed by two other men seconds later for the same piece of bread. “When they withdrew, next to me were two corpses, side by side, the father and the son. I was fifteen years old.”

The one thing that disturbs me greatly about the book is the seemingly misinformation that Wiesel writes. To me, there seems to be a few factual errors in the book. For example, if according to the knowledge of the Nazis, he was supposed to be 18 when he entered the camps, not 15, why at Buchenwald was he put in the Children’s Barrack? He should have been 19 by then. The most disturbing piece of error in the life of Weisel was that it the 1980s he claimed to be in the famous Buchenwald photograph that was taken 5 days after the liberation. However according to Wiesel, he was in the hospital 3 days after liberation and stayed there for two full months. Now I do not mean to discredit Wiesel and call him a liar, however, I feel that detail were lost and things may have been exaggerated especially in the efforts to win him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 (perhaps the reason he claimed to be in the picture). Due to lost records of the time, the true events may never be known, but the reality is that whether or not Wiesel’s story is completely real or not, it still serves us a testament to horrors of one of the worst crimes in human history and a constant reminder that a people, we cannot let such monstrosities occur again.

  *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* and it’s two direct sequels, *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* and *Life, The Universe, and Everything* are the first three books in Douglas Adam’s Hitchhiker’s Guide series, and adaptation of his radio series of the same name. After reading these two books, I can say that these are the two funniest books I have read in a long time, even slightly surpassing my reading of *Alice in Wonderland *last month. I would recommend the books to anyone looking for a good laugh for a couple hours, especially if they enjoy such books as *Alice in Wonderland*. Like*Alice in Wonderland*, the books are “nonsense-novels” created purely for the humour and enjoyment of the reader but still may contain some deeper meaning. However, Adams manages to employ many more forms of humour in his works than Carroll does in his.

Like *Alice in Wonderland*, the book uses the humourous aspect of randomness to make the reader laugh. An example of this is the situation with the rats. As it turns out, humans are not the dominant species on Earth, but rather third. In fact the dominant species are the rats! The funniest example however by far was when Arthur Dent, the main character randomly makes a Sperm Whale and a Bowl of Petunias appear in the middle of space.


> “Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.”

Another example, and probably the most well known, is the grand conclusion to the Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything is not some great saying or deep and philosophical advice. No, rather it is simply 42. **42.**  This randomness provides quick laughs throughout the book that keep it constantly entertaining.

Although the book is riddled with random humour, the funniest parts consist of the other two types of humour. The first is irony. Some of the funniest parts of the book are simply due to irony of its situations. For example, after finding out that the answer to Life, The Universe and Everything is 42, a group of super-intelligent beings design the earth to explain that answer. The Earth is designed to run a 10-million year long program to find the answer, but exactly 5 minutes before the successful completion of the program, the Earth is destroyed by an alien race called the Vogons who think it’s in the way of the intergalactic hyperpass highway they wish to build. The irony of the situation is absolutely hilarious. Another example of the irony at work is Dent’s enemy Agrajag. Agrajag is a being who keeps getting killed unknowingly by Arthur Dent and then gets reincarnated, just to be killed by Arthur again. In one of the situations, Arthur is hunting a boar for food which turns out later to have been one of Agrajag’s reincarnations. Then as Arthur is cooking the boar, he sees a fly and swats it with the pig’s skin. As it turns out that fly was a reincarnated version of Agrajag which was born once the pig was killed.

Finally, the last type of humour that Adams employs has no real category other than being “intelligent humour.” Instead of being random or ironic, this humour uses proper logic in unconventional ways that makes it funny. An example of such is Arthur Dent’s flying lessons. Unable to grasp flying easily, he figures that since he is quite good as missing targets and quite good at falling, he will just fall and miss the ground, which ends up allowing him to fly. Another example of the “intelligent humour” are the impossible inventions that Adams imagines up. While there are many great examples such as the Bistromathic Drive and the Happy Vertical People Transporter, my two personal favourites are the Infinite Improbability Drive and the Total Perspective Vortex. The first is a teleportation system that employs quantum theory to teleport. It is based on the idea that while a particle is most likely to be in the nuclei of an atom (where it is supposed to be), there still must be a miniscule chance that it can be anywhere. Therefore, if you are able to manipulate that probability you, can make the odds greater that the particles are elsewhere, and make them teleport! The Total Perspective Vortex is a system to kill enemies in which you give the victim a simulated view of the universe in its entirety which is infinite therefore forcing the victim to fathom the proportionality of themselves and realize that they are so infinitely insignificant that they cease to exist. All these “intelligent humours” are all based on (somewhat) sound logic but spun in such an absurd way that they are funny!

Although the books comes off at face value as a set of total nonsense, like *Alice in Wonderland*, upon closer inspection, the novels actually do contain some deeper themes. An easily seen example of this is the direct connection between the conflict regarding supernova bombs in the book and nuclear bombs in our own real world. All of the things said about supernova bombs in the book such as how any planet that creates them is crazy as it will destroy them as well applies directly to our world with nuclear weapons and countries. Another example is the Vogon’s destruction of the Earth due to the wanting to create a hyperspace highways. This could be seen as a reference to the metaphorical destruction of the Earth, which is really the environment, through unnecessary human activities represented by the creation of yet another hyperspace highway.

These books are perfect for anyone looking to find read something funny but doesn’t want “stupid humour” like fart jokes and such, but rather well-thought-out and well-crafted humour that will actually make you laugh. Adams manages to use enough types of humour to appeal to all audiences and even manages to sneak a couple of deeper themes into the mix. The definitely deserve 5 out of 5 stars in my book.

  In Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, Carroll uses political allusions to entertain the indirect, adult audiences of the book. Many of the complicated topics and themes contained in the book are much too difficult for the younger, children audiences to understand. As the story is supposed to be a funny, fantastical fairy tale, the primary audience of this story is young children as they are the ones who are generally interested in stories of the sort. However, a common practice in Western Cultures is that children are read fairy tales by their parent, often before bedtime. In many cases, the fairy tales are so simplistic, that parents are often bored while reading them to their children. Carroll used this knowledge to create a fairy tale that mantains its primary audience as being for younger children, yet mixes in enough “more-intricate” story elements to keep these adults reading alongside interested in the tale.

The major example of a story element which corroborates this premise is the King’s Court. While the idea of good and bad is understood by the small children, they are unable to grasp the more complicated political undertone of the section. The novel was published in 1865. The adults who were a reading the book at the time period, would have easily noticed the connections to the the February Revolutions happening in nearby France in which corrupted court systems were used by the king of France to crush out the rebellion. In France, the king would use his power to act as the judge himself, to make sure that his will was always carried out, an exact replica which is done in Alice in Wonderland by the king and queen.


> “’Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen. ‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.) ‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) ‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’ ‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.’ There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. ‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen.”

In this example from the book, the king and queen are able to manipulate the truth however they want and no one is able to question them because of their power. This sort of historical allusion would be near impossible for the young children of the time to understand as many of them were not even born during the February Revolutions!

In Through the Looking Glass, the war is during a chess game between Red and White, as opposed to the traditional Black and White. Upon further examination, it turns out that there is actually deeper meaning behind the choice of colours. This is a direct political allusion to yet another series of wars, not so close timewise, but in Carroll’s own home country of England. During the war, the white roses represented the House of York while the red roses represented the House of Lancaster. In the first book, the Queen would often exclaim, “Off with his head” to numerous different characters. This is a clear cut reference to Queen Margaret’s famous quote, *“Off with the crown, and, with the crown, his head.” *The prolonged wars between the two houses vying for power after the 100 year war was characterized by equal matchup and nearly even wins. This is clearly characterized by the fight between the red and white knights during Through the Looking Glass in the quote, *“One Rule seems to be that if one Knight hits another he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses he tumbles off himself.” *This political allusion would be well known to the adult audiences of the book, as they would have a decent understanding of the history of their own nation, but the topic is too advanced to have been commonly taught during the younger grades, the primary audience of Alice in Wonderland. Therefore, the political allusion must be directed towards the older audiences of the book, who would have been educated enough to recognize the historical allusions.

In conclusion, Lewis Carroll definately uses historical allusions in his novels as a means to entertain older audiences. This is clear as the topics of these allusions are complicated enought that they would not be understood by the younger children who are the primary audience simply because they had not yet been educated enough to understand them.

  The most interesting thing that I noticed while watching this movie was that the Nazi officials were not the “monsters” that are often projected in Western media and propaganda, but rather they were, for the most part, well-educated (many of them lawyers), well-mannered, cultured, “civilized”. It seems astonishing to us today that their murderous actions could originate from such “refined people” and a high-level culture. However, it is important to remember that the Holocaust was indeed cold-blooded evil, but calculated, cold-blooded evil. The Holocaust was a huge undertaking, of such a massive scale that “it would astonish Charles Darwin,” and thus needs people with the ability to run such a massive operation.

If it were not for the warning that my history teacher, Mr. Evans, gave me at the beginning of the movie, that all the men at the meeting were evil, some more evil than others, I feel I would have been tricked into falling under the misguided impression that some of the characters like Kritzinger and Stuckart were if not good, then at least decent men. But due to the warning, I was able to pay closer attention to their actions, and realized that they too were evil. Stuckart at one point says, “Yes purge the Jews, but to annihilate them?” One of the most interesting things about Stuckart as a character is trying to pinpoint his motivation. Is he truly “more understanding of the Jew” from his experience as he claims or is he simply acting out of pride authorship and disguising it as protecting Jews from evacuation. At one point, he nearly says “my laws” but catches himself and says “Nuremberg Laws.” Stuckart’s “Species but Not Race” speech was one of the most interesting points of the entire movie I feel, because it really gave insight into how the Nazi officials saw (and were split over their perceptions of) the Jewish people.

In that speech, he mentions the Jews’ rejection of Jesus Christ as one of the faults of their race. However, later on in the movie, Heydrich says that neither the Catholics nor the Lutherans would object to the “evacuation” of the Jews. This made me wonder about the presence of religion in Nazi Germany. So after an internet search, I found that about 55% of Germans were protestant, 40% were Catholic, and 5% were either Atheist or non-denominational (but still believing in a higher power). However, what I found most interesting about this is that the 5% Atheist or non-denominational were significantly overrepresented in the Nazi Party and government officials compared to their population in Germany. This disturbs me greatly, as it gives a bad name to atheists. Examples like this and that Communism supported abolishment of religion are often examples people use to claim that atheism is inherently evil and that without religion, people do not have a sense of morality. However, this argument is completely fallacious as religion (or lack of it) is not the driving force behind all evil, it is, as in the Nazi situation, often power, wealth, and hatred. There are many evil dictators who did support religion who committed similar atrocities: Assad, Mussolini, Hasina, etc. On a side note, I found it interesting that apparently, some Nazis even supported “Nazifying” Christianity into something called Positive Christianity in which they renounce Christianity’s Jewish origins such as the Old Testament and hold Hitler as the new Messiah.

I took a look at the 1984 German movie Die Wannseekonferenz that Conspiracy is based on and watched a couple minutes of it just to get sense of it. The most shocking disparity I noticed, which was probably more accurate in the earlier movie was the in the seating arrangement of the table, Heidrich sat in the middle of one side of the table and was surrounded on both sides by his SS “cronies” while the lawyers, government officials, and bureaucrats sat on the opposite side of the table. This seating arrangement, I feel better pictured the duality and split between the people at the meeting. It really showed that the SS was in charge and the reality that the meeting was not for the SS to discuss with the administrative officials about how to deal with the “Jewish Problem” but rather for the SS to inform the administrative officials of the killing plans, and to demand their support.

The movie was truly eye-opening to me as it displayed the true nature of the Nazi Administration. If there is one thing I had to take from this movie, it is that the argument many make: “That the Nazis were simply following orders” is false, at least for many of the higher up Nazi officials. While it may not be true for Nazi soldiers, the Nazi high-levels were not being forced (with exceptions like Kritzinger who just needed a little push) to commit terrible deeds, they were fully aware and knowledgeable about what they were doing and supported their actions. The “simply following orders” argument is a fallacious one that simply does not reflect the reality of the situation.

  There are 1.3 million identified animals species that occupy the Earth right now. Scientists estimate there are still over 6.4 million left to discover. However out of all these species that walk the Earth, only one of them has built a skyscraper. Only one of them has adapted itself to live on every single continent. Only one of them has figured out how to leave our home planet. Out of all these species, only one of them is human. Humans are different than all other species but what gives us the competitive edge over the rest? The hands we have been dealt have played in our favor. The ability to walk erect, to tame fire, and to grasp firmly has all been part of what made us. It is what brought us from ape to man. But what really makes us man? Our species is what it is because of one core concept: we have the desire to communicate. This one trait separates us from the rest and define us as humans.

By communicating, we strengthen ourselves as a species. We are able to share our knowledge that can mutually benefit us all. We can spread the knowledge that we know through generations and beat the test of time. In the Amazon Rain Forest there is a species known as the Red Fire Ant that is constantly in threat of annihilation by flash floods. However this species manages to hang on by literally joining together and making a raft, holding on for months at a time. Safety comes in numbers. And when you add the power of communication, you can go from making rafts to making cities.

The first Trans-Atlantic telegraph cable was created from 340,500 miles of copper and iron wire and was designed to stretch 2,876.95 miles once the cable was in place. Why did we bother doing this? It’s all part of our need for communication. Once the cable was in place, we could use electrical impulses to send any message to the other side of the world. Human beings are hard-wired for the impulse to share our ideas and the desire to know that we’ve been heard. When we die, we want to have left a legacy, something to communicate to future generations who we were and what we did. As humans, we crave the idea of having our thoughts heard.

200,000 years ago one of the greatest evolutionary advancements in human evolution takes place. The larynx, or voice box, decides to descend down the throat of our ancestors, allowing us to make more distinct vocal sounds. This is the first form of communication that sets us apart. The ability to communicate was a survival tactic; it was the power to share knowledge. If one individual knew something, he could share this information with the rest of his pack. Now the individual contained the knowledge of many individuals rather than his own. This comparable to having a stand-alone computer vs. a network of 100’s of computers. But this was only the first step in the timeline of human communication; 180,000 years later, humans will develop the skill that will take their powers of communication farther than ever before. In Northern Siberia, the oldest found representation of “cave drawings” have been found; humans had discovered art. Art allows humans to convey messages more efficiently. Even today, the basic concept of art is still the same, it serves to communicate a message or emotion to its viewer. Finally, 5000 years ago, the final crucial step in making man the social creature it is was the advent of a written language. This new invention allowed us to connect people who may never meet each other. Text can transcend both time and space, connecting an individual with others from the other side of the world or even millennia apart.

Even with these three mediums, man is still hungry for more. He craves social interaction. Two hundred years ago, less than 3% of the world’s population lived in a city. Today this number is over 50%. In the last hundred years alone, communicating our thoughts has advanced more than in the previous 4000. New technologies were invented to transmit our thoughts quicker and farther. The telegraph, telephone, radio, television, internet, email, social networks are all attempts made by humans to bring us closer together by more efficiently we send these bits of information that we desire to communicate and will use to benefit us all. We used these new mediums of communication to accomplish some of our greatest feats. We are able to organize ourselves and contribute ideas to our greatest achievements such as landing on the moon and creating metropolitan cities. We worked together to bring these feats to reality.

Today the average human will say 2,250 words to an average of 7.4 other individuals. We’ll send over 300 billion emails and 19 billion text messages all in attempt to spread our message and leave an impact. Man is not a social creature, rather a social creature is man.

  Don't take it too seriously.

  A short film I helped out on, directed by some friends for entrance to the NJ High School film festival.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfuDqYpKizY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
The spring of 2011 was a time of turmoil. It was a time of democracy. It was a time of revolution. The Arab Spring saw the end of one of the most interesting modern empires today, Gaddafi’s Libya. The leader of the Libyan nation was a dictator by the name Muammar Gaddafi and by the end, his people despised him. However, it was not always this way. During his ascension to power and early building of his empire, Gaddafi was a great leader, helped the nation, and was loved by the Libyan citizens.

To fully understand the rise of the Libyan empire, it is essential to understand the culture and demographics of Libya itself. Libya is a large country, about the size of Alaska, located in Northern Africa. Despite its size, it is very sparsely populated with only 6.5 million people, with the majority concentrated along the coast in Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan, while the lower part of the country is largely the Sahara desert. It is neighbored by Egypt and a small part of Sudan to the East, Chad and Niger to the South, Algeria and Tunisia to the West and the Mediterranean Sea to the North. Libya is part of a region known as the Maghreb, which is characterized as a crossroads of Arab and African cultures. The vast majority of people (95%) read, speak and write in Arabic (with the rest speaking an ethnic language called Berbers), and follow many of the customs and traditions of its Eastern neighbors, including Egypt. The country’s official religion is Islam and it is a high oil-exporting nation unlike its Saharan neighbors to the West and South. However, it still retains some African heritage; the country’s cuisine is distinctly like its southern neighbors. Historically, Libya has maintained strong tribal roots with about 140 ethnical tribes and clans in Libya that will play a big role in Gaddafi’s empire.

Italy, which hovers over Tripoli in the Mediterranean, controlled Libya in its empire from 1912 to 1951. Gaddafi’s tribe, Qadhadfa, played a part in the nation’s liberation from Italy. Later in his life, he even claimed that his paternal grandfather was the “first martyr in Khoms, in the first battle of 1911.” When he was 6, he viewed the deaths of his two cousins at the hands of the Italian Royal Army. This event dramatically changed his views on colonial powers, the Western world and particularly Italy. During this time in school, Gaddafi was fascinated by events in the Arab world, especially Egypt. He saw Egyptian president Famel Abdel Nasser as a role model and saw him as a hero during his rise to power in 1952. He then joined the military and trained in Libya and the United Kingdom’s, reaching the rank of Lieutenant. Despite his actual rank, he preferred to be called Colonel Gaddafi. Even in 1976, after he took power, when the Arab Socialist Union’s National Congress tried to confer the rank of Major General, he accepted the honorary rank but stated that he should be continued to be called Colonel and even work the rank of Colonel on his uniform. This was a very strategic maneuver as it made him seem much more relatable to the people as he did not seem like an antiquated general, but rather a fresh military face.

On September 1st 1969, Gaddafi led a coup d’etat with his fellow officers. They carried out the mission while King Idris of Libya was in Turkey for a medical treatment. Among the conspirators, he was chosen to become the Revolutionary Chairman of the new Libyan Arab Republic, once they abolished the monarchy. Upon gaining power, Libya enjoyed a time of economic prosperity as Gaddafi used the country’s natural resources to develop the nation. The country’s literacy rate rose from 10% to 90%, life expectancy rose from 57 to 77 years, equal rights for women and blacks were established, welfare systems were instituted, and financial support was given to universities. Gaddafi’s popularity skyrocketed. As an extremely effective form of propaganda, Gaddafi would direct many large infrastructure projects, such as the Great Manmade River, a series of pipes that brought fresh water to people all over the country. This “water highway” is often called the 8th wonder of the world. All this was done without foreign debts, leaving Libya in a great economic position and debt-free.

In order to solidify his political propaganda, Gaddafi took some time to write his own manifesto, The Green Book, a tribute to Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book. In the book, he bolstered himself as a savior of Libya and Africa by denouncing both capitalism and communism and proposed that dictatorship is the only proper form of government. He wrote, “The era of the masses, which follows the age of the republics, excites the feelings and dazzles the eyes. But even though the vision of this era denotes genuine freedom of the masses and their happy emancipation from the bonds of external authoritarian structures, it warns also of the dangers of a period of chaos and demagoguery, and the threat of a return to the authority of the individual, the sect and party, instead of the authority of the people. Theoretically, this is genuine democracy but, realistically, the strong always rules. That is, the stronger party in the society is the one that rules.” This popular book is what allowed him to rule over his citizens with great ease.

Despite Libya’s early success, Gaddafi was not content. He wanted to change Libya’s perception on the world stage. He forged a powerful alliance with Egypt’s Nasser. When Nasser died in 1970, Gaddafi used his close friendship to frame himself as Nasser’s successor as the leader of Arab Nationalism. His goal was to merge the Arab states of North Africa into one, the “Great Islamic State of the Sahel.” He sent missionary work to both Sudan and Chad and successfully Islamized them, so that a potential annexation would go much more smoothly. However, Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry, refused to join Libya, and then signed a peace agreement with Sudanese Christians. Once diplomacy failed, Gaddafi responded by launching an invasion in Chad. After a quick war due to the support of many Chadians, Gaddafi placed an ally, Hissene Habre, in charge of Chad.. After many power struggles within the Chad, Oueddei was exiled to Algeria and Habre became the ruler of Chad. Habre became allies with Gaddafi and helped him with his “Green Revolution,” an attempt to make Libya the center of the African Arab World.

Nasser’s successor, Anwar Sadat, and Gaddafi made a partial union between the two nations. However, when Gaddafi a suggested a full union, with Sadat being the President and Gaddafi being the Defense Minister, Sadat didn’t trust him and refused. Gaddafi declared war on Egypt but lost by a small margin. When his onceally, Sadat, died on October 6th 1981, Gaddafi was so overjoyed that he declared it a national holiday. Throughout Gaddafi’s rule, he caused conflicts with many other nations trying to merge them including Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. After Libya’s “falling out” with Egypt, Gaddafi made a new friend and ally in the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. After the “fall-out” Gaddafi gave up on the Arab world and began his biggest political project, The United States of Africa. With support from Local Warlords, who gave him the title, King of Kings, and Nelson Mandela, he even planned on making an African currency, the Dinar, like the Euro.

While Gaddafi was being praised by his own citizens, his reputation in Western nations was unstable. Almost as soon as taking office, Gaddafi shutdown many American and British military bases including the US’s prized Wheelus Air Base. Gaddafi also told western oil companies that unless they shared their revenue, they would be expelled from the nation. In the Green Book, he claimed that the West was performing acts of terrorism against Libya. In a Time interview, he stated “America is involved in a conspiracy [against the Arab world], primarily because of its policy toward Israel. In our view, whoever is against the Americans stands with us. The enemy of your enemy is your friend.” Tensions heightened when in 1972, in response to hatred from Israel and other North African nations, Gaddafi tried to persuade both China and Pakistan into selling Libya a nuclear bomb. When both attempts were unsuccessful, Gaddafi then focused on making chemical weapons. Gaddafi was put on international shame for his terroristic activities including his part in the Lockerbee bombings and support for the Irish Republic Army.

After the fall of the Soviets, Gaddafi reassessed his position on the global platform at began to make better relations with the West, even admitting his part in the Lockerbee bombings and giving up his supply of over 23 metric tons of mustard gas and 1,300 tons of chemicals. However, it was too little, too late and Gaddafi did not give up many of his treacherous ways, including human rights issues. Gaddafi’s godlike affection from within his own country fell by the late 2000s as the Libyan economy fell drastically and unemployment rocketed. Unable to stand it anymore and being inspired by the Egyptian Revolution, in the spring of 2011, civilians organized protests against Gaddafi. Soon the uprisings backed by NATO turned into a full-on civil war in which Gaddafi lost his power and then soon after, his life.

While Gaddafi did a very good job at building the foundation of his empire through his massive propaganda machine, his biggest flaw was being unable to shift this machine towards other nations. Gaddafi expected other rulers to always comply by his rules like his own citizens did. This worked in the case of Chad, where he sent missionaries to spread pro-Libyan propaganda, which made his essential takeover much smoother. However, in later attempts of unification with other nations, he did not do this, and thus never had the support of his potential conquered peoples. If he had continued with the strategy employed in Chad, endeavors such as the United States of Africa would have been far more successful. Furthermore, with few allies in his ring, he angered many bigger players than himself such as the UK and USA, which caused him major point on the international stage, which only drove away other potential allies in fear of invoking the wrath of the United States. Muammar Gaddafi’s Libyan empire is a great example of empire building but also one of an empire that did not expand and maintain itself properly due to external factors.

  Frankenstein was undoubtedly one of the finest pieces of literature of the late 19th century. Although, the tale has been horribly disfigured by modern media, the original novel is a deep and philosophical one that spreads its core message that the pursuit of knowledge can be dangerous. It is a representation of the struggle between enlightenment and romanticism during the time period. The novel was written by Mary Shelley, undoubtedly one of the most prolific writers of the time period, however, what many don’t realize is that many of Shelley’s ideas came from the influence of her family, most notably her mother and her husband.

The enlightenment was a time period in the 1700s during which thinkers turned to rational thought and reason as a means to explaining the world around them as opposed to religion or spirituality. However, many enlightenment thinkers did their best to force their beliefs upon others, many whom were critical of this new way of thought. One of these such people was Mary Shelley’s mother. Her mother, a strict feminist, criticized the enlightenment for doing nothing to improve women’s. In fact, many enlightenment thinkers claimed that women were unable of rational thought. She criticized that in the enlightenment, only men were able to engage in the pursuit of knowledge and a movement that promoted equality was portraying women as inferior to men.

Mary Shelley lived in a time of history where the world was still in transition phases from the romantic era to the enlightenment, a time in which both sides were coexisting. At this time, the romantics, who believed that not everything can be explained with rational thought and that sometimes nature needs no explanation, in order to hold back the onward march of the enlightenment, flooded the literary market with romantic novels. These romantics texts which dominated the literary market focused on themes such as love, terror, and fear, aspects of the human condition which the enlightenment followers could not yet explain with rational thought. Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley’s husband and a romantic writer himself, was very sensitive to the literary works and the emotions they conveyed. Thus when he edited his wife’s work, he worked in many romantic elements.

The complementary influences of Mary Shelley’s mother’s critisism of the Enlightment and her husbands love of romanticism worked together to augment and shape Mary Shelley’s main message of the dangers involved in the pursuits of knowledge. Mary voicing her mothers concerns over the unequal representation of women in the enlightment is seen through the obvious lack of female characters in the novel. In order to spite this world view even further, she gives the male characters severe character flaws that show that they are just as uncapable of rational thought as they claim women are. Due to Percy Shelley’s editing of the novel, the perception of the monster changed due to his romantic views. He managed to make the monster into a true monster instead of a human. Due to this, we see sudden shifts in tone and style throughout the novel, often times changing the readers perception of the monster altogether.

Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein was influenced by both Shelley’s mother and husband. Her mother’s viewpoints shaped Mary Shelley’s and made her weasel in numerous critiques about the abuses of the enlightenment era when it comes to feminism. Due to Percy Shelley’s extensive editing, the novel lost a lot of its uniformity as Shelley’s own view of the monster and what it represents constantly was in conflict with her husbands. While Mary Shelley may have great messages and ideas of her own, in her novel Frankenstein, they were masked by the thoughts of her mother and husband, and due to their influences, the novel could not truly be representation of Shelley herself, but rather her environment as a whole.
